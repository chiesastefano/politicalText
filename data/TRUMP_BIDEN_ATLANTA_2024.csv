17,"And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let's begin the debate.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
18,"And let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
19,"For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100, then, now costs more than $120. And typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
20,What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
21,"We've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic was so badly handled.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
22,"Many people were dying. All he said was it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm. You'll be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
23,"The unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. And that's exactly what we began to do.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
24,"We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there's more to be done. There's more to be done. Working-class people are still in trouble.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
25,"I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household where the kitchen table – if things weren't able to be met during the month, was a problem.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
26,"Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
27,"That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems, and we're going to make sure that we have reduced the price of housing.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
28,"We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can't take over.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
29,The combination of what I was left with and corporate greed are the reason why we're in this problem right now.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
30,"In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done at his administration, he didn't do much at all.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
31,"By the time he left, there's – things were in chaos, literally chaos. And so we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
32,"We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for",Biden,Atlanta,2024
33,"– for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include (ph) beginning next year.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
34,"And the situation is making – and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we're working to bring down the price of – around the kitchen table.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
35,And that's what we're going to get done.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
36,Thank you. President Trump?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
37,We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have never done so well. Every – everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
38,"And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
39,By the time we finished – so we did a great job.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
40,"We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
41,"But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates – that was a disaster for our country.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
42,"But other than that, we had – we had given them back a – a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID. And nobody thought that was even possible.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
43,"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce-back jobs, they're bounced back from the COVID. He has not done a good job. He has done a poor job.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
44,And inflation's killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
45,Thank you. President Biden?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
46,"Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he's the only one who thinks that, I think.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
47,I don't know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
48,"And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy, he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
49,"He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
50,"The idea that he did something that was significant. And the military, you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. And he didn't do anything about that.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
51,"When he was president, we were still finding ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
52,"The truth is, I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any this – this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
53,"President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can, you want –",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
54,Am I allowed to respond to him?,Trump,Atlanta,2024
55,"Well, I'm going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you. I want to follow up.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
56,You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. How will you ensure that that doesn't drive prices even higher?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
57,It's not going to drive them higher.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
58,"It's just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China – and many others, in all fairness to China – it's going to just",Trump,Atlanta,2024
59,"force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things. But he – he made a statement.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
60,The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. And that's why we had all the jobs.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
61,And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounce-back jobs. You can't do that. He also said he inherited 9 percent inflation.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
62,"No, he inherited almost no inflation, and it stayed that way for 14 months.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
63,And then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn't know what they were doing. And they don't know what they were doing.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
64,It was the worst – probably the worst administration in history. There's never been.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
65,"And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
66,"He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
67,"President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record highs.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
68,"And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. While so far, President Biden, you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
69,"So former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
70,"With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
71,"Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
72,It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
73,"Now, when we cut the taxes, as example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that, we took in more revenue with much",Trump,Atlanta,2024
74,less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
75,"We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
76,We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
77,"I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with, we – we gave him something great.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
78,"Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
79,"Something which a lot of people don't like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating it. The vaccine went out.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
80,"He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
81,"And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership. They don't respect the United States anymore.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
82,"We're like a Third World nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent. All of the things he's done. We've become like a Third World nation, and it's a shame.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
83,"The damage he's done to our country – and I'd love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails, and",Trump,Atlanta,2024
84,mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
85,"President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
86,"He had the largest national debt of any president in a four-your period, number one. Number two, he – that $2 trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
87,"I – what I'm going to do is fix the tax system. For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean, billionaires in America. And what's happening?",Biden,Atlanta,2024
88,"They're in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
89,"If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they'd raised $500 million – billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
90,We'd be able to right wipe out his debt.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
91,"We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do – childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making",Biden,Atlanta,2024
92,sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the – with – with – with the COVID.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
93,"Excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with – look, if – we finally beat Medicare.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
94,"Thank you, President Biden. President Trump?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
95,"Well, he's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death. And he's destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in, they're putting them on Medicare. They're putting them on Social Security.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
96,"They're going to destroy Social Security. This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they're trying to put them on Social Security.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
97,He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence. And it's a shame.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
98,"What's happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries, I'm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
99,"We're no longer respected. They don't like us. We give them everything they want, and they think we're stupid. They think we're very stupid people.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
100,"What we're doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
101,"Thank you, President Trump. Dana?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
102,This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
103,"This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho, despite that state's restrictive ban.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
104,"Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
105,Correct.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
106,"However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. They're used in about two-thirds of all abortions. As president, would you block abortion medication?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
107,"First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
108,"And if you look at this whole question that you're asking, a complex, but not really complex. Fifty-one years ago, you had Roe v.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
109,"Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. Everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
110,"And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
111,This is something that everybody wanted.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
112,"Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this are getting into other things, but every legal scholar, throughout the world,",Trump,Atlanta,2024
113,"the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that. Now the states are working it out.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
114,"If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – it was – it was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
115,"Kansas, I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they're all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That's the vote of the people.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
116,"Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions, I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
117,"Some people, you have to follow your heart, some people don't believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. I think it's very important.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
118,Some people don't. Follow your heart. But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You've got to get elected.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
119,"The problem they have is they're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
120,"If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we do with the baby.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
121,"Meaning, we'll kill the baby. What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It's been a great thing.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
122,Thank you. President Biden?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
123,"It's been a terrible thing, what you've done. The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
124,And that was – that's – this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous. And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
125,"We're (ph) in a state where in six weeks, you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see the doctor or have your – and have",Biden,Atlanta,2024
126,"him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help. The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we're going to turn civil rights back to the states.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
127,"Let each state have a different rule. Look, there's so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he – he went to the funeral.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
128,"The idea that she was murdered by a – by –by an immigrant coming in, and they talk about that.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
129,"But here's the deal, there's a lot of young women who are being raped by their – by their in-laws, by their – by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by",Biden,Atlanta,2024
130,– just – it's just – it's just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they tried to arrest them when they cross state lines.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
131,Thank you.,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
132,There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
133,We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world – considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
134,"And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country. And they are raping and killing women, and it's a terrible thing.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
135,"As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting. In many cases, they – it's frankly a very liberal decision. In many cases, it's the opposite.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
136,"But they're voting. And it's bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn't.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
137,But they would have – everybody want it brought back. Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn't able to get it.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
138,"Everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it. And again, this gives it the vote of the people.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
139,And that's where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
140,"Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden. Seven states –",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
141,I'll let you do that. This is the same topic. Seven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion.,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
142,Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
143,"I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters. First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
144,"And a third time is between the doctor – I mean, it'd be between the woman and the state.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
145,The idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about women's health is ridiculous. That's the last – no politician should be making that decision.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
146,"A doctor should be making those decisions. That's how it should be run. That's what you're going to do. And if I'm elected, I'm going to restore Roe v. Wade.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
147,"So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states – Democrat-run – take it after birth.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
148,"Again, the governor – former governor of Virginia: put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
149,"So he's in – he's willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby. Nobody wants that to happen. Democrat –",Trump,Atlanta,2024
150,No.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
151,"– or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
152,You're lying. That is simply not true. That Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That's not the circumstance.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
153,"Only when the woman's life is in danger, if she's going to die – that's the only circumstance in which that can happen. But we are not for late term abortion, period – period, period.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
154,"Under Roe v. Wade, you have late term abortion. You can do whatever you want, depending on the state. You can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
155,"We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
156,"For 51 years, that was the law. Fifty-one years, Constitutional Scholarship said it was the right way to go.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
157,"Fifty-one years, and it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. He takes credit for taking it away. What's he going to do?",Biden,Atlanta,2024
158,"What's he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control of the Congress and they pass a universal",Biden,Atlanta,2024
159,"ban on abortion, period, across the board, at six weeks, or seven, or eight or ten weeks, something very, very conservative. Is he going to sign that bill? I'll veto it. He'll sign it.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
160,Thank you.,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
161,Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security.,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
162,"President Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
163,"some cases causing real safety and security concerns. Given that, why should voters trust you to solve this crisis?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
164,"Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, but it made sure that we are in a situation where you had",Biden,Atlanta,2024
165,no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
166,"Significantly – by the way, the Border Patrol men endorsed me, endorsed my position.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
167,"In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking – separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
168,"That's not the right way to go. What I've done – since I've changed the law, what's happened?",Biden,Atlanta,2024
169,I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. That's better than when he left office.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
170,And I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the – the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
171,President Trump?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
172,"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either. Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
173,The border – all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
174,"He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
175,"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
176,"They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. They're pouring in. And this guy just left it open. And he didn't need legislation.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
177,"Because I didn't have legislation, I said close the border. We had the safest border in history.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
178,"In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol, who is great – and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won't say that.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
179,"But they endorsed me for president. Brandon, just speak to him. But look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There's never been anything like it.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
180,"And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.",Trump,Atlanta,2024

259,"No, they're not acceptable. No, they're not acceptable. But look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war, he led everybody along.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
260,He's given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He's given $200 billion. That's a lot of money. I don't think there's ever been anything like it.,Trump,Atlanta,2024

268,And then do you think he'll stop there? Do you think he'll stop when he – if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus?,Biden,Atlanta,2024
269,"What do you think happens to those NATO countries? And so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he's going to do.",Biden,Atlanta,2024

271,"United States, we give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That's why it's – that's why we're strong.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
272,"Thank you. Moving on to the Middle East. In October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than a thousand people and taking hundreds of hostages.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024

280,They don't work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.,Biden,Atlanta,2024

298,He has no idea what the hell he is talking about.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
299,"And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was this – this kind",Biden,Atlanta,2024
300,of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
301,"President Trump, just a follow-up, would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state in order to achieve peace in the region?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024

305,"But, the big thing I changed is they don't want to pay.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
306,And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
307,"I said, and he is right about this, I said, no, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay. They asked me that question.",Trump,Atlanta,2024

362,"He should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
363,But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he's done. He's done horrible things.,Trump,Atlanta,2024

370,"Number two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American, just because you're a president, is wrong, is simply wrong. No president's ever spoken like that before.",Biden,Atlanta,2024

379,"– when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you're reporting it.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
380,And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we've ever taken in the history of any campaign.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
381,I don't think any campaign has ever taken hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it's a scam and it's a guy that's after his,Trump,Atlanta,2024

401,He made up the Charlottesville story and you'll see it's debunked all over the place. Every anchor has – every reasonable actor has debunked it.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
402,And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It's a nonsense story. He knows that. And he didn't run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
403,President Biden?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
404,And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time. And the idea that somehow that's the only reason I ran.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
405,I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
406,"If he thought they were good people coming out of that all – that for us, carrying those – those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn't deserve to be",Biden,Atlanta,2024

408,"We saw the people breaking to the windows. We saw people occupying there. His own vice president – look, there's a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused endorsing this time.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
409,"His vice president hasn't endorsed him this time. So, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?",Biden,Atlanta,2024
410,"Thank you, President Biden. We're going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024

412,"President Biden, while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less than white families.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
413,Black mothers are still three times more likely to die for pregnancy related causes. And black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans.,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
414,What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven't made more progress?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
415,"They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history.",Biden,Atlanta,2024

419,"When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
420,We've got to make sure we provide for childcare costs.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
421,"We've got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
422,"So there's more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up and they know it.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
423,You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
424,"I say, I don't blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
425,"For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
426,"I made sure that we're in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if",Biden,Atlanta,2024
427,"they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after",Biden,Atlanta,2024

429,Thank you. President Trump?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
430,"And he caused the inflation. He's blaming inflation. And he's right, it's been very bad. He caused the inflation and it's killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It's killing people.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
431,They can't buy groceries anymore. They can't. You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can't live. They're not living anymore. He caused this inflation.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
432,"I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
433,He destroyed it with his green news scam and all of the other – all this money that's being thrown out the window. He caused inflation.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
434,"As sure as you're sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
435,They're taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people.,Trump,Atlanta,2024

437,Thank you. President Biden?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
438,"There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15% unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
439,"That's why there was no inflation at the time. There were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved communities, including minority communities.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
440,We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with the ACA has increased.,Biden,Atlanta,2024

442,"He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they're going to try again if they win.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
443,We find ourselves in a position where the idea that we're not doing any – I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
444,"He wants to cut the cops. We're providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on.",Biden,Atlanta,2024

450,"Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
451,"We can't, in the 1990s (ph), we can't forget that. Super predators was his name.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
452,"And he called it to them for 10, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.",Trump,Atlanta,2024

458,And you haven't seen anything yet. It's a disaster.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
459,"38 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024

461,"And we did – we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
462,"And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
463,"I don't know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I've passed the most extensive, it was the extensive climate change legislation in history, in history.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
464,"We find ourselves – and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don't have the kind of",Biden,Atlanta,2024
465,contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing any white student can do. They just have the money.,Biden,Atlanta,2024

470,"The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a rip off of the United States.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
471,And I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones who was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it.,Trump,Atlanta,2024

480,And we're going to – we're moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
481,"But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about – about pollution and about climate, I've not seen any indication of that.",Biden,Atlanta,2024

492,"So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
493,"After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.",Biden,Atlanta,2024

532,"Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn't be a debate. He is the worst president.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
533,"He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country. He's destroyed our country.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
534,"Now, all of a sudden, he's trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out – came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
535,"A little bit, like this much. It's insignificant. He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
536,"And I don't think – we just can't let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
537,We probably won't have a country left anymore. That's how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
538,"Thank you, President Trump. President Biden?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
539,We are the most admired country in the world. We're the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
540,"The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we're weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one. Number two, the idea that we're talking about worst presidents.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
541,"I wasn't joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don't hold me the exact number, presidential historians. They've had meetings and they voted who's the worst president in American history.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
542,"One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That's a fact. That's not conjecture. He can argue the wrong, but that's what they voted.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
543,The idea that he is knowing (ph) – doing anything to deal with child care. He did very – virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
544,"We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold",Biden,Atlanta,2024
545,– to have child care facilities.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
546,"Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, the question was about what would you do to make child care more affordable? If you want to take your minute.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
547,"Just you understand, we have polling. We have other things that do – they rate him the worst because what he's done is so bad. And they rate me – yes, I'll show you.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
548,"I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK. And if I'm given another four years, I will be the best. I think I'll be the best.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
549,Nobody's ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He's the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
550,"He wants to raise everybody's taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
551,"Nobody ever heard of this before. All my life I'd grow up and I'd see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
552,"Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country. The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
553,President Biden?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
554,"Look, the fact of the matter is that he's dead wrong about it. He's increased the tariff – he's increased – he will increase the taxes on middle class people.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
555,"I said I'd never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn't. But this tariff – these 10 percent tariffs, everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say?",Biden,Atlanta,2024
556,"That's going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they're going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
557,"Number two, he's in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised – he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
558,"Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
559,"You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one. Number two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
560,We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
561,"Thank you, President Biden. Thank you, President Biden. Let's discuss an epidemic impacting millions of Americans that both of you have made a top priority in your first term, the opioid crisis.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
562,"And for both of you, the number of overdose deaths in this country has gone up. Under your term, it went up. Under your term, it has gone up.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
563,"Former President Trump, despite the efforts that both of you have made, more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses every year, primarily from fentanyl and other opioids.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
564,"What will you do to help Americans right now in the throes of addiction, who are struggling to get the treatment they need?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
565,"To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He's a Manchurian Candidate.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
566,He gets money from China. So I think he's afraid to deal with him or something. But do you notice?,Trump,Atlanta,2024
567,He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can't because it's too much money. It's tremendous.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
568,"And we saved our steel industries. And there was more to come, but he hasn't done that. But he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't, because it's too much money.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
569,But he's got the largest deficit in the history of our country and he's got the worst situation with China.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
570,"China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they're doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can't let that happen.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
571,You're destroying our country.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
572,"So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
573,"The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
574,"Jake, we're doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody's ever had before, any country in every way.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
575,"And then we had to get tough. And it was – the drugs pouring across the border, we're – it started to increase. We got great equipment. We bought the certain dog.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
576,"That's the most incredible thing that you've ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had – we were getting very low numbers. Very, very low numbers.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
577,"Then he came along. The numbers – have you seen the numbers now? It's not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don't even talk about gotaways.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
578,"But the numbers of – the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I've ever seen at numbers – nobody's ever seen",Trump,Atlanta,2024
579,under him because the border is so bad. But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we've ever had by far.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
580,"President Trump, thank you. President Biden?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
581,Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
582,"And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
583,"That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal. More fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
584,"And when we had that deal done, he went – he called his Republican colleagues said don't do it. It's going to hurt me politically. He never argued. It's not a good bill.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
585,It's a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
586,And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together. That's what we have to do. We need those machines.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
587,"Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, and again, the question is about Americans in the throes of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
588,"Because this does pertain to it. He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made the catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
589,"We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
590,"It's just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a – every time we sees hostage. Now we have a hostage.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
591,"A Wall Street Journal reporter, I think a good guy, and he's over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
592,"I will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office. I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
593,He should have had him out a long time ago. But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
594,We had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people. I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
595,"Thank you, President Trump. Dana.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
596,"Let's turn to concerns that voters have about each of you. President Biden, you would be 86 at the end of your second term.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
597,How do you address concerns about your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
598,"Well, first of all, I spent half my career being – being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
599,And now I'm the oldest. This guy's three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I've done.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
600,Look how I've turned around the horrible situation he left me.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
601,"As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions – billions of dollars in private investment and – and enterprises that we are growing.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
602,"We've – by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people – the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
603,And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap – to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product. So I went – I went to South Korea.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
604,"I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to – to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
605,You don't need a college degree for them.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
606,"And there's billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over – from all over the world.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
607,"President Biden, you have 40 seconds left. Would you like to add anything?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
608,"Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We – we're the envy of the world.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
609,Name me a single major country president who wouldn't trade places with the United States of America.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
610,"For all our problems and all our opportunities, we're the most progressive country in the world and getting things done. We're the strongest country in the world.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
611,"We're country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
612,"And our – those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don't want to screw around with us.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
613,"Thank you. Former President Trump, to follow up, you would be 82 at the end of your second term. What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
614,"Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
615,"I'd like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn't do it. But I took two cognitive tests.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
616,"I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I'm in very good health.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
617,"I just won two club championships, not even senior, to regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball along way.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
618,And I do it. He doesn't do it. He can't hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can hit a ball 50 years.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
619,"I think I'm a very good shape. I feel that I'm in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I'm probably a little bit lighter.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
620,But I'm in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same. But I took – I was willing to take a cognitive test.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
621,"And you know what, if I didn't do well – I aced them. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who's great guy, when he was White House doctor.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
622,"And then I took another one, a similar one, and both – one of them said they'd never seen anybody ace them.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
623,Thank you. President Biden?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
624,You're going to see he's six-foot-five and only 225 pounds – or 235 pounds.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
625,.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
626,"Well, you said six-four, 200.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
627,.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
628,"Well, anyway, that's – anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is. Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
629,"I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6. And by the way, I told you before I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
630,Think you can do it?,Biden,Atlanta,2024
631,"That's the biggest lie that he's a 6 handicap, of all.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
632,I was 8 handicap.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
633,Yeah.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
634,"Eight, but I have – you know how many…",Biden,Atlanta,2024
635,"I've seen your swing, I know your swing.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
636,"President Trump, we're going to…",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
637,Let's not act like children.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
638,You are a child.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
639,"To you, a specific concern that voters have about you.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
640,Will you pledge tonight that once all legal challenges have been exhausted that you will accept the results of this election regardless of who wins and you will say right,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
641,now that political violence in any form is unacceptable?,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
642,"Well, I shouldn't have to say that, but, of course, I believe that. It's totally unacceptable.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
643,"And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it's",Trump,Atlanta,2024
644,one of the strongest statements you've ever seen.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
645,"In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
646,"They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police. And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
647,"She said that loud and clear. But the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
648,And I'll tell you something – I wish he was a great president because I wouldn't be here right now. I'd be at one of my many places enjoying myself.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
649,"I wouldn't be under indictment because I wouldn't have been his political appoint – you know, opponent. Because he indicted me because I was his opponent. I wish he was a great president.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
650,"I would rather have that. I wouldn't be here. I don't mind being here, but the only reason I'm here is he's so bad as a president that I'm going to make America great again.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
651,We're going to make America great again. We're a failing nation right now. We're a seriously failing nation. And we're a failing nation because of him. His policies are so bad.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
652,His military policies are insane. They're insane. These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we're closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
653,"We are very, very close to World War Three, and he's driving us there.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
654,"And Kim Jong Un, and President Xi of China – Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of these – Putin – they don't respect them. They don't fear him.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
655,They have nothing going with this gentleman and he's going to drive us into World War Three.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
656,"If you want a World War Three, let him follow (ph) and win, and let Putin say, do what you want to NATO – just do what you want.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
657,"There's a thing called Article Five, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
658,The idea – the idea – I can't think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn't trade place with what job I've done and what they've done,Biden,Atlanta,2024
659,"because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They're capable of anything and they step up when they're needed.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
660,"And right now, we're needed. We're needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
661,"And again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
662,Then you have a war.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
663,"President Trump, as I come back to you for a follow-up. The question was, will you accept the results of this election regardless of who wins?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
664,"Just to finish what he said, if I might, Russia – they took a lot of land from Bush. They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
665,"They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing. He knew not to do it. He's not going to play games with me. He knew that.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
666,"I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games. He took nothing from me, but now, he's going to take the whole thing from this man right here.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
667,That's a war that should have never started. It would've never started ever with me.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
668,"And he's going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with – he's got us in such a bad position right",Trump,Atlanta,2024
669,now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine's not winning that war.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
670,"He said, I will never settle until such time – they're running out of people, they're running out of soldiers, they've lost so many people. It's so sad.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
671,"They've lost so many people and they've lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions. Russia would've never attacked if I were president.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
672,"President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election regardless of who wins? Yes or no, please?",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
673,If it's a fair and legal and good election – absolutely.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
674,"I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we'll have a news conference on it in a week or",Trump,Atlanta,2024
675,we'll have another one of these on – in a week. But I will absolutely – there's nothing I'd rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I'm running again.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
676,"I wasn't really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He's destroying our country. I would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
677,"And again, no indictments, no political opponent's stuff, because it's the only way he thinks he can win.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
678,"But unfortunately, it's driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
679,Let's see what your numbers are when this election is over.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
680,We'll see.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
681,"Let's see. You're a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
682,"Not one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none. But you continue to provoke this lie about somehow there's all this misrepresentation, all the stealing.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
683,There's no evidence of that at all. And I tell you what? I doubt whether you'll accept it because you're such a whiner.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
684,"The idea if you lose again, you're accepting anything, you can't stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
685,We'll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia.,Moderator,Atlanta,2024
686,"It is now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements. As predetermined by a coin toss, we're going to begin with you, President Biden. You have two minutes.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
687,We've made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his – in his last term.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
688,"We find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
689,"I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?",Biden,Atlanta,2024
690,"The fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I'm reelected, that'll be the case again.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
691,"But this guy is – has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he's increased inflation because of the debacle he left after – when he handled the pandemic.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
692,And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything comes into the United States America.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
693,"What I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with – and get rid of the ability of Medicare to – for the ability to – for the",Biden,Atlanta,2024
694,"– us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies. Well, guess what? We got it – we got it down to 15 – excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
695,"No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they – how much prescription they need. You know what that did?",Biden,Atlanta,2024
696,That reduced the federal deficit (ph) – debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn't have to pay the exorbitant prices.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
697,"I'm going to make that available to every senior, all – or go longer. It's happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that.",Biden,Atlanta,2024
698,We have – I'm going to make sure we have childcare. We're going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
699,I'm going to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
700,We're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.,Biden,Atlanta,2024
701,"Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.",Moderator,Atlanta,2024
702,"Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
703,"We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn't do anything. He doesn't do.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
704,All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn't respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan.,Trump,Atlanta,2024
705,"We didn't stop – Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
706,"Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever.",Trump,Atlanta,2024
