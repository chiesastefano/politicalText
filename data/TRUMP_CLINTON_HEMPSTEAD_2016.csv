1,"Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
2,"The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
3,"The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
4,We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
5,"At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
6,"From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
7,The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
8,"I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
9,"of the United States, Donald J. Trump.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
10,"How are you, Donald?",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
11,"Good luck to you. Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
12,"We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
13,"I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
14,"Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
15,"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
16,"There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
17,"However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
18,"Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
19,"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
20,"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
21,"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
22,"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
23,"We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work. I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
24,"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
25,And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
26,"I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
27,Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. How are we going to do it?,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
28,"We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
29,"Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
30,"You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
31,I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
32,"Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money—more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
33,"Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
34,"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
35,"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
36,"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
37,"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
38,"You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
39,"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
40,"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
41,"But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
42,"All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left—fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
43,"We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
44,That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
45,"New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
46,"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
47,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
48,"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
49,And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
50,"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
51,"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
52,"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
53,"I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
54,"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
55,I don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
56,"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
57,"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
58,we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
59,"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
60,"How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
61,"Well, for one thing—and before we start on that—my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions",Trump,Hempstead,2016
62,"of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country's in deep trouble.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
63,"We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
64,"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
65,"And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
66,"When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in—automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
67,"It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton—yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
68,"It's very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
69,"And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...",Trump,Hempstead,2016
70,"Let me interrupt just a moment, but...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
71,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
72,"What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
73,"Back to the question, though. How do you bring back—specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
74,"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
75,"They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
76,We wish you a lot of luck.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
77,"But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
78,"And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those",Trump,Hempstead,2016
79,"companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
80,Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
81,"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
82,"That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
83,"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
84,"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."" Well, it did collapse.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
85,"That's called business, by the way.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
86,"Nine million people—nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
87,And it has not been easy.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
88,"So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
89,"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
90,"by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
91,another recession.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
92,"They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
93,we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
94,Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
95,I did not. I did not. I do not say that.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
96,I think science is real.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
97,I do not say that.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
98,"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
99,We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
100,"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
101,"the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
102,Mr. Trump?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
103,"She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
104,"Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
105,"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
106,"The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
107,"He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
108,"And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
109,"And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
110,"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?",Trump,Hempstead,2016
111,"For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
112,"Well, actually...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
113,I will bring—excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
114,"Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
115,"Yeah, for 30 years.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
116,"And I have—well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
117,"Well, he approved NAFTA...",Trump,Hempstead,2016
118,"... million new jobs, a balanced budget...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
119,"He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
120,"Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
121,"When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America?",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
122,"Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
123,And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
124,"I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
125,"We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable. When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
126,We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
127,Very quickly...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
128,But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...,Trump,Hempstead,2016
129,"Well, I've been a senator, Donald...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
130,You haven't done it. You haven't done it.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
131,And I have been a secretary of state...,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
132,Excuse me.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
133,And I have done a lot...,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
134,"Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
135,"Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
136,"You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
137,"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
138,"Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
139,"But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
140,"Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
141,You called it the gold standard.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
142,You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
143,No.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
144,"And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
145,"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are—I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
146,Not.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
147,"... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
148,So is it President Obama's fault?,Trump,Hempstead,2016
149,... before you even announced.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
150,Is it President Obama's fault?,Trump,Hempstead,2016
151,"Look, there are differences...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
152,"Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?",Trump,Hempstead,2016
153,There are...,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
154,Because he's pushing it.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
155,"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
156,And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
157,"That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
158,But you have no plan.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
159,"But in—oh, but I do.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
160,"Secretary, you have no plan.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
161,"In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called ""Stronger Together."" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
162,That's about all you've...,Trump,Hempstead,2016
163,"Folks, we're going to...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
164,... or at an airport near you.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
165,We're going to move to...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
166,"But it's because I see this—we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
167,So we have a very robust set of plans.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
168,"And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
169,You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
170,"Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
171,"It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. When I go around—Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
172,"And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing—the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
173,"You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
174,"I'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
175,"Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into—we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
176,That can't—that can't be left to stand.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
177,Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
178,"I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
179,Facts.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
180,"So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
181,"So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
182,"And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
183,"... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
184,"What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
185,And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
186,"Well, you just opened the next segment.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
187,"Well, could I just finish—I think I...",Trump,Hempstead,2016
188,I'm going to give you a chance right here...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
189,"I think I should—you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
190,... with a new 15-minute segment...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
191,She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
192,"Mr. Trump, I'm going to...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016

201,"That's a—that's—go to the—please, fact checkers, get to work.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
202,"OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
203,"Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
204,"I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
205,"Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
206,"I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax—it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
207,It's a great thing for companies to expand.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
208,"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring",Trump,Hempstead,2016
209,"the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what—is so",Trump,Hempstead,2016
210,"bad. So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
211,"And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to—and everybody agrees it should be brought back.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
212,"Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
213,"Because we have—we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
214,"I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
215,"And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
216,"But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
217,"All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
218,"I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
219,Why not?,Trump,Hempstead,2016
220,"Why not? Yeah, why not? You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
221,There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
222,"This is—this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
223,Yes.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
224,"Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
225,"I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
226,Then you didn't read it.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
227,I happen to—I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016

234,... it is...,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
235,"Lester, how much?",Trump,Hempstead,2016
236,"... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
237,"And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
238,I don't think top-down works in America.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016

242,"Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
243,Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
244,"Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
245,"And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down. We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
246,And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political—by keeping the interest rates at this level.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
247,"And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise",Trump,Hempstead,2016
248,"interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
249,"Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
250,And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to—who he owes it to and any business conflicts.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
251,Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016

256,"When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because",Trump,Hempstead,2016
257,"everybody—Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?",Trump,Hempstead,2016

262,"Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
263,"I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year. And in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
264,I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't. I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
265,"I will release my tax returns—against my lawyer's wishes—when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release. I will release my tax returns.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
266,"And that's against—my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."" I will tell you this. No—in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
267,"When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
268,So it's negotiable?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
269,"It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...",Trump,Hempstead,2016
270,"Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
271,Secretary Clinton?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
272,"Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
273,"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
274,"We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit. So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
275,"And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
276,"Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
277,"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
278,"were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
279,any federal income tax.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
280,That makes me smart.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
281,"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
282,"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
283,"terrible, that he's trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
284,And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
285,"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding. And we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
286,"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to?",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
287,"Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
288,He also—he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
289,"I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
290,That's for sure.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
291,"And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
292,Mr. Trump?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
293,That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
294,"When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
295,"And believe me, this country thinks it's—really thinks it's disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
296,"You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
297,"The report that said $650—which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
298,It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
299,"The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was—actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
300,And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
301,"But I could give you a list of banks, I would—if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
302,I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
303,It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
304,"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our",Trump,Hempstead,2016
305,"bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
306,"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible—you come",Trump,Hempstead,2016
307,"in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land—we've become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
308,"We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
309,"Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And it's really a shame.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
310,And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
311,"And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
312,We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
313,And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. And the other thing I think is important...,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
314,"It would be squandered, too, believe me.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
315,"... is if your—if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
316,"You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
317,"And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016

319,We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
320,"And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
321,Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...,Trump,Hempstead,2016
322,"Well, to...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
323,"Which our country should do, too.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
324,"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the",Clinton,Hempstead,2016

326,"He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
327,"And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
328,You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
329,Wrong. Wrong.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
330,"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
331,Let's let Mr. Trump...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
332,And we need to be very clear about that.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
333,"So, yeah, I think—I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
334,"Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
335,"But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.",Trump,Hempstead,2016

345,The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.,Trump,Hempstead,2016

347,"The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police,",Moderator,Hempstead,2016

349,"So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
350,"Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
351,"Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
352,We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
353,"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
354,"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
355,"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
356,I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
357,"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
358,So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
359,"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
360,We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
361,"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
362,"All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
363,"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
364,"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.",Trump,Hempstead,2016

375,"But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
376,And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be—we have to know what we're doing.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
377,"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
378,"Your two—your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
379,"No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
380,"They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
381,The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
382,"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them. These are felons.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
383,"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from",Trump,Hempstead,2016
384,"the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
385,"It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago. But when you look—and Chicago's not the only—you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
386,"I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
387,"But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
388,So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
389,Secretary Clinton...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
390,"But we need—Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
391,And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
392,Secretary Clinton?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
393,"Well, I've heard—I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
394,Ugh.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
395,"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
396,There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
397,"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
398,"It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
399,"We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
400,Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
401,"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
402,So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
403,"We have to say—we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
404,too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
405,I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
406,So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
407,"Right now—and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby—right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
408,"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
409,And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
410,"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
411,"Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
412,"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
413,"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
414,"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
415,"deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
416,"They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
417,"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
418,Mr. Trump...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
419,I'd like to respond to that.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
420,Please.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
421,"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
422,"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
423,"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
424,"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
425,I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
426,"And that's a term that I think was a—it's—it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
427,"And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
428,"And I don't think—I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
429,"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe—in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
430,"Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
431,"And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
432,"It had a very, very big impact.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
433,"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
434,"No, you're wrong. You're wrong.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
435,"No, I'm not.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
436,Murders are up. All right. You check it.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
437,"New York—New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit—I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
438,"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
439,And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
440,"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
441,"And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
442,"This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
443,"I'd like to just respond, if I might.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
444,Please—20 seconds.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
445,I'd just like to respond.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
446,"Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
447,"I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
448,"They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
449,"The African-American community—because—look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
450,They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
451,"Mr. Trump, let me...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
452,"Well, I—I do think...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
453,"And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities—and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just—you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
454,"You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
455,"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
456,"Mr. Trump, I...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
457,"I think—I think—I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
458,And I think that's a good thing.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
459,"Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
460,"In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
461,"I'll tell you very—well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close—very close friend of Secretary Clinton.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
462,"And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to—during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
463,"And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
464,"They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
465,And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
466,That was...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
467,"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because",Trump,Hempstead,2016
468,I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
469,I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
470,"You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
471,Yeah.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
472,".... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
473,"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
474,But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
475,"I mean, you know—now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
476,"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter—you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
477,"But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
478,"I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up—and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
479,"What do you say to Americans, people of color who...",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
480,"Well, it was very—I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
481,"But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
482,And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
483,"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
484,Secretary Clinton?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
485,"Well, just listen to what you heard.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
486,"And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
487,to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can't be dismissed that easily.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
488,He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
489,"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold,",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
490,apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
491,"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
492,"African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
493,"So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
494,And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
495,"But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
496,"And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
497,"Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
498,"I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
499,And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
500,"You were after him, you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
501,"But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
502,"Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along",Trump,Hempstead,2016
503,"with many, many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued. We settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
504,"I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
505,"Maybe I'm trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look—I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?",Trump,Hempstead,2016
506,"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things. I'll go one step further.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
507,"In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
508,"No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
509,"And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
510,"Our next segment is called ""Securing America."" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
511,"So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it? Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
512,"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
513,There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
514,"But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
515,"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
516,"I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really... ...tough, long game here.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
517,"And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
518,"And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
519,"We need to make it very clear—whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else—the United States has much greater capacity.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
520,"And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
521,And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
522,But we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
523,"I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
524,And that's why I was so—I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
525,It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information—in administrations...,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
526,Your two minutes have expired.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
527,... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
528,"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
529,"I do want to say that I was just endorsed—and more are coming next week—it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here—admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
530,"That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
531,"I was just recently endorsed—16,500 Border Patrol agents.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
532,"So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led",Trump,Hempstead,2016
533,our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
534,"As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
535,"I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't—maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
536,"It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? You don't know who broke in to DNC.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
537,"But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
538,That's what we learned.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
539,"Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that",Trump,Hempstead,2016
540,we used to have control over.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
541,"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is",Trump,Hempstead,2016
542,"doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is—it is a huge problem. I have a son.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
543,"He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
544,"But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
545,"We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
546,Secretary Clinton?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
547,"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
548,"I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
549,in our country and Europe and elsewhere.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
550,"But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end",Clinton,Hempstead,2016

554,And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
555,"I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
556,"And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016

561,"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
562,"Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. ""We will take out ISIS."" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because",Trump,Hempstead,2016
563,"they got out—what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
564,She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,Trump,Hempstead,2016

573,Wrong. Wrong.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
574,"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
575,"But the larger point—and he says this constantly—is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
576,"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
577,"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks?",Clinton,Hempstead,2016

581,"So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016

597,"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",Trump,Hempstead,2016

600,"Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest—but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
601,"And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
602,And I think we should get—because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
603,"But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they're going to do that.",Trump,Hempstead,2016

630,"I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
631,"And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
632,"And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.",Trump,Hempstead,2016

645,Secretary Clinton?,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
646,"Whew, OK. Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
647,"You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
648,And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
649,"After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
650,"With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
651,They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
652,"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
653,So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
654,"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
655,"The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
656,"He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
657,That would not start a war.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
658,"That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
659,"No, they were taunting us.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
660,"... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
661,"It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
662,"He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
663,Wrong.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
664,"... have a good time, folks.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
665,It's lies.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
666,"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
667,And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
668,"So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
669,"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...",Trump,Hempstead,2016
670,"It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
671,It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things—and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
672,"The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your—your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
673,"Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
674,"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing—we're losing—we lose on everything. I say, who makes these—we lose on everything.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
675,"All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.",Trump,Hempstead,2016

677,We need to move on.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016

679,They have to help us out.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
680,Our last...,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
681,"As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
682,"Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here on the, still on the subject of securing America.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
683,"On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
684,"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
685,But Russia has been expanding their—they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
686,"I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not—we are not keeping up with other countries.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
687,"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
688,"At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
689,China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
690,"And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
691,"Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
692,"And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal?",Trump,Hempstead,2016
693,"One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
694,"It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",Trump,Hempstead,2016
695,This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,Trump,Hempstead,2016
696,"All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
697,Your two minutes is expired.,Moderator,Hempstead,2016
698,"And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.",Trump,Hempstead,2016
699,"All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.",Moderator,Hempstead,2016
700,"Well, let me—let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
701,And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America's word be good.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
702,And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
703,"But I want to—on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
704,It's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
705,"But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
706,Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran?,Clinton,Hempstead,2016
707,"If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
708,"But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
709,"So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.",Clinton,Hempstead,2016
