1,"Good evening, I'm David Muir. And thank you for joining us for tonight's ABC News Presidential Debate. We want to welcome viewers watching on ABC and around the world tonight.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
2,Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump are just moments away from taking the stage in this unprecedented race for president.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
3,"And I'm Linsey Davis. Tonight's meeting could be the most consequential event of their campaigns, with Election Day now less than two months away.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
4,"For Vice President Kamala Harris, this is her first debate since President Biden withdrew from the race on July 21st. Of course, that decision followed his debate against President Donald Trump in June.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
5,"Since then, this race has taken on an entirely new dynamic.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
6,And that brings us to the rules of tonight's debate: 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. No topics or questions have been shared with the campaigns. The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
7,"And this is the clock. That's what they'll be seeing. Two minutes for rebuttals and one minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. Their microphones will only be turned on when it's their turn to speak.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
8,No prewritten notes allowed. There is no audience here tonight in this hall at the National Constitution Center. This is an intimate setting for two candidates who have never met.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
9,President Trump won the coin toss. He chose to deliver the final closing statement of the evening. Vice President Harris selected the podium to the right.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
10,So let's now welcome the candidates to the stage. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
11,Kamala Harris. Let's have a good debate.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
12,Nice to see you. Have fun.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
13,Thank you.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
14,Thank you.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
15,Welcome to you both. It's wonderful to have you. It's an honor to have you both here tonight.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
16,"Good evening, we are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
17,"So let's get started. I want to begin tonight with the issue voters repeatedly say is their number one issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living in this country.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
18,"Vice President Harris, you and President Trump were elected four years ago and your opponent on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters, are you better off than you were four years ago?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
19,"When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
20,"So, I was raised as a middle-class kid. And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
21,"I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
22,"Because here's the thing. We know that we have a, a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
23,We know that young families need support to raise their children.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
24,"And I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
25,"So that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children. My passion, one of them, is small businesses.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
26,I was actually--my mother raised my sister and me but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
27,"My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
28,"My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
29,result in $5 trillion to America's deficit.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
30,"My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
31,"Economists have said that that Trump's sales tax would actually result for middle-class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
32,be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
33,"President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
34,"First of all, I have no sales tax. That's an incorrect statement. She knows that. We're doing tariffs on other countries.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
35,"Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
36,"I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can't.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
37,It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do. They're taking in billions of dollars from China and other places. They've left the tariffs on.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
38,"When I had it, I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation. Uh, look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has--which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
39,We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
40,"But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
41,"This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
42,"On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
43,And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. And you see what's happening.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
44,"You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
45,These are the people that she and Biden let into our country. And they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get 'em out.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
46,We have to get 'em out fast. I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. I'll do it again and even better.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
47,We are going to get to immigration and border security during this debate. But I would like to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
48,"Well, I would love to. Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us. Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
49,Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
50,And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
51,What we have done and what I intend to do is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
52,"But I'm going to tell you all, in this debate tonight, you're gonna hear from the same old, tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
53,What you're gonna hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
54,I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
55,And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
56,"President Trump, I'll give you a minute here to respond.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
57,"Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know and as she knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
58,"I don't wanna read it, purposely. I'm not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
59,But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do--everybody knows I'm an open book. Everybody knows what I'm going to do. Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
60,We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was--not since 1917 where 100 million people died has there been anything like it.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
61,We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
62,Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns. We got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. And people give me credit for rebuilding the military.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
63,"They give me credit for a lot of things. But not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs. These were jobs, bounce-back.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
64,And it bounced back and it went to their benefit. But I was the one that created them. They know it and so does everybody else.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
65,"Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
66,"So, Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan, it's all about tax breaks for the richest people.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
67,"I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy, and the best economists in our country, if not the world, have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
68,What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse. Mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan would actually explode the deficit.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
69,"Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and, by the middle of next year, would invite a recession.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
70,You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
71,"And I'd invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
72,That's just a sound bite. They gave her that to say.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
73,"Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan, it's a great plan.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
74,"It's a plan that's gonna bring up our worth, our value as a country.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
75,"It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and, uh, create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our--for our country.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
76,"And just to finish off, uh, she doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences, like run-Spot-run. Four sentences that are just oh, we'll try and lower taxes.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
77,She doesn't have a plan. Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
78,"Mr. President, I do want to drill down on something you both brought up.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
79,"The vice president brought up your tariffs you responded and let's drill down on this because your plan is, what she calls is a essentially a national sales tax.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
80,"Your proposal calls for tariffs as you pointed out here, on foreign imports across the board.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
81,"You recently said that you might double your plan, imposing tariffs up to 20% on good coming into this country.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
82,As you know many economists say that with tariffs at that level costs are then passed onto the consumer.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
83,"Vice President Harris has argued it'll mean higher prices on gas, food, clothing medication arguing it costs the typical family nearly four thousand dollars a year.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
84,Do you believe Americans can afford higher prices because of tariffs.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
85,"They aren't gonna have higher prices what's gonna have, and who's going to have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
86,"I charge, I was the only president ever--China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars and so were other countries and you know if she doesn't like 'em they",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
87,shouldaa gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs but those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
88,"We are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
89,"I had no inflation, virtually no inflation, they had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country because I've never seen a worse period of time.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
90,People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else. These--the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they've done.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
91,They've destroyed the economy and all you have to do is look at a poll. The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that the Trump economy was great that their economy was terrible.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
92,Vice President Harris I do want to ask for your response and you heard what the president said there because the Biden administration did keep a number of the Trump,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
93,tariffs in place so how do you respond?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
94,"Well, let's be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we've ever seen in the history of America.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
95,"He invited trade wars, you wanna talk about his deal with China--what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump's presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
96,"help them improve and modernize their military. Basically sold us out, when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
97,"Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies; focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
98,"A.I., on quantum computing; focusing on what we need to do to support America's workforce, so that we don't end up having the--on the short end of the stick in",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
99,"terms of workers' rights. But what Donald Trump did, let's talk about this, with COVID, is he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during COVID.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
100,"Look at his tweet. ""Thank you, President Xi,"" exclamation point. When we know that Xi was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
101,"President Trump, I'll let you respond.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
102,"First of all, they bought their chips from Taiwan. We hardly make chips anymore because of, uh, philosophies like they have and policies like they have. I don't say her because she has no policy.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
103,"Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was gonna send her a MAGA hat.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
104,"She's gone to my philosophy. But, if she ever got elected, she'd change it. And it will be the end of our country. She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
105,Her father's a Marxist professor in economics. And he taught her well.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
106,But when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly where,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
107,"it's, I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people say, and I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
108,And just look at what they're doing to our country. They're criminals. Many of these people coming in are criminals. And that's bad for our economy too.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
109,"You know, you mentioned before, we'll talk about immigration later. Well, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy. They have, and she has, destroyed our country with policy that's insane.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
110,Almost policy that you'd say they have to hate our country.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
111,"President Trump, thank you. Linsey?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
112,"I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe v. Wade.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
113,"Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
114,"In your home state of Florida, you surprised many, uh, with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said,",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
115,"""I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks."" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
116,"ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn't trust you on the issue of abortion because you've changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
117,"Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
118,"They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
119,"He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby. And that's why I did that, because that predominates.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
120,"Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
121,"But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
122,"And that's not okay with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something, for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
123,"And through the uh genius and, and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
124,I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans do--exceptions. It's very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
125,"And for the first time you're gonna see--look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
126,"Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that's what happened, happened.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
127,"Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
128,It's not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
129,And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
130,"There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam Vice-President, I want to get your response to President Trump.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
131,"Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that's not actually a surprising fact. Let's understand how we got here.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
132,Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
133,And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
134,Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
135,"Which, understand what that means: A survivor of a crime of violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
136,"And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
137,I have talked with women around our country. You wanna talk about this is what people wanted?,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
138,"Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
139,go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn't want that. Her husband didn't want that.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
140,A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don't want that.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
141,"And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
142,"But understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
143,"Understand, in his Project 2025 there would be a national abortion--a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
144,"I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
145,"Thank you, Vice President Harris.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
146,"Well, there she goes again. It's a lie. I'm not signing a ban. And there's no reason to sign a ban. Because we've gotten what everybody wanted.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
147,"Democrats, Republicans and everybody else and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states. And the states are voting.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
148,"And it may take a little time, but for 52 years this issue has torn our country apart. And they've wanted it back in the states. And I did something that nobody thought was possible.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
149,"The states are now voting. What she says is an absolute lie. And as far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of abortion ban.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
150,"But it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
151,Would you veto a national abortion ban if it came to your desk--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
152,"--Well, I won't have to because again--two things. Number one, she said she'll go back to Congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
153,Especially now with a 50-50 in--essentially 50-50 in both Senate and the House. She's not gonna get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
154,You know what it reminds me of? When they said they're gonna get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
155,"The student loans--and then her--I think probably her boss, if you call 'em a boss, he spends all his time on the beach--but look, her boss went out and said",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
156,"we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court. So all these students got uh, taunted with this whole thing about--this whole idea.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
157,And how unfair that would have been-- part of the reason they lost--to the millions and millions of people that hadda pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
158,"But they were saying--it's the same way that they talked about that, that they talk about abortion.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
159,But if I could just get a Yes or No. Because your running mate jen--J.D. Vance has said that you would veto if it did come to your desk.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
160,"Well, I didn't discuss it with J.D., in all fairness. J.D.--and I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me, but I really didn't.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
161,"Look, we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get--they didn't even come close to getting student loans.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
162,They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people--and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
163,So it doesn't matter what she says about going to Congress. Wonderful. Let's go to Congress. Do it.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
164,But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of Congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldn't be done.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
165,And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
166,"Vice President Harris, I want to give you your time to respond. But I do want to ask, would you support any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
167,"I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and, and, and asking for an abortion.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
168,That is not happening. It's insulting to the women of America. And understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
169,"Couples who pray and, and, and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
170,"What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs, who can barely afford childcare as it is, have to travel to another",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
171,"state--to get on a plane sitting next to strangers--to go and get the health care she needs. Barely can afford to do it, and what you are putting her through is unconscionable.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
172,"And the people of America have not--the, the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
173,"And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
174,Vice President Harris--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
175,"Excuse me, I have to respond. Another lie. It's another lie. I have been a leader on IVF which is fertilization. The IVF--I have been a leader.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
176,"In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
177,"I've been a leader on it. They know that and everybody else knows it. I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
178,"And the other thing, they--you should ask, will she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
179,Come on.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
180,Would you do that? Why don't you ask her that question--,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
181,"Why, why don't you answer the question would you veto-–",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
182,That's the problem. Because under Roe v. Wade.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
183,"Answer the question, would you veto--",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
184,"You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
185,--That's not true.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
186,"And probably after birth. Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia. The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
187,"President Trump, thank you.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
188,"We're going to turn now to immigration and border security. We know it's an issue that's important to Republicans, Democrats, voters across the board, uh, in this country.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
189,"Vice President Harris, you were tasked by President Biden with getting to the root causes of migration from Central America. We know that illegal border crossings reached a record high in the Biden Administration.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
190,"This past June, President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions. We know the numbers since then have dropped significantly.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
191,But my question to you tonight is why did the administration wait until six months before the election to act and would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
192,"So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
193,"And let me say that the United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came up with a border security bill which I supported.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
194,And that bill would have put fifteen hundred more border agents on the border to help those folks who are workin' there right now overtime trying to do their job.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
195,It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
196,I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
197,"That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings. But you know what happened to that bill?",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
198,"Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill. And you know why? Because he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
199,"And understand, this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
200,But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
201,"And I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when it's not the subject that is being raised.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
202,And I'm going to actually do something really unusual and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies because it's a really interesting thing to watch.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
203,"You will see, during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
204,And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
205,"And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about, is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your ne--your desires.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
206,"And I'll tell ya, I believe you ne--deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
207,"Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, on that point I want to get your response.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
208,"Well, I would like to respond.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
209,"Let me just ask, though, why did you try to kill that bill and successfully so? That would have put thousands of additional agents and officers on the border.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
210,First let me respond as to the rallies. She said people start leaving. People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
211,"And the people that do go, she's busing 'em in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
212,"We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That's because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. We're a failing nation.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
213,"And it happened three and a half years ago. And what, what's going on here, you're gonna end up in World War 3, just to go on to another subject.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
214,What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
215,"And a lotta towns don't want to talk--not gonna be Aurora or Springfield. A lotta towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
216,The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating--they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
217,"As far as rallies are concerned, as far as--the reason they go is they like what I say. They wanna bring our country back. They wanna make America great again. It's a very simple phrase.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
218,"Make America great again. She's destroying this country. And if she becomes President, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success. We'll end up being Venezuela on steroids.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
219,"I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio. And ABC News did reach out to the city manager there.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
220,"He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community--",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
221,"Well, I've seen people on television--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
222,Let me just say here this--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
223,--the people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
224,I'm not taking this from television. I'm taking it from the city manager--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
225,--but the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
226,"Again, the Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
227,--We'll find out--,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
228,"--Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond to the rest of what you heard.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
229,Talk about extreme.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
230,"Um, you know, I uh, this is I think, one of the reasons why in this election I actually have the endorsement of 200 Republicans who have formally worked with",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
231,"President Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain including the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressmember Liz Cheney.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
232,"And if you wanna really know the inside track on who the former President is, if he didn't make it clear already, just ask people who have worked with him.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
233,"His former Chief of Staff, a four-star general, has said he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. His former National Security Adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
234,"His former Secretary of Defense has said the nation, the republic would never survive another Trump term.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
235,"And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in this election.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
236,"President Trump, I'll give you a quick minute to respond.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
237,"Yeah. Uh, thank you. Because when I hear that--see, I'm a different kind of a person. I fired most of those people. Not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
238,I fired 'em. They never fired one person.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
239,"They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people who's, who's--were just killed, viciously and violently killed, and I got to know the parents and the family.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
240,"They should have fired all those Generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. So when somebody does a bad job, I fire 'em.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
241,"And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
242,With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. And they never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look how--look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
243,"They have the same people. That's a good way not to have books written about you. But, just to finish, I got more votes than any Republican in history by far.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
244,"In fact, I got more votes than any President, sitting President in history by far.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
245,Let me continue on immigration. It was what you wanted to talk about earlier. So let's get back to your deportation proposal that the Vice President has reacted to as well.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
246,"President Trump, you called this the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country. You say you would use the National Guard.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
247,"You say if things get out of control you'd have uh, no problem using the U.S. military.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
248,With local police.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
249,"You also said you would use local police. How would you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants? I know you believe that number is much higher. Uh, take us through this. What does this look like?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
250,Will authorities be going door to door in this country?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
251,"Yeah. It is much higher, because of them. They allowed criminals. Many, many, millions of criminals. They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
252,"They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country, and they're now in the United States.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
253,And told by their countries like Venezuela don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down?,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
254,You know why? Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her to put into our country.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
255,"And, this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them to allow--and I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get votes. But it's not worth it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
256,Because they're--they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done. There's never been anything done like this at all. They've destroyed the fabric of our country. Millions of people let in.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
257,And all over the world crime is down. All over the world except here. Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
258,Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
259,"President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is actually coming down in this country, but Vice President Harris I'll give you--",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
260,"--excuse me, the FBI defraud--they were defrauding statements. They, they didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a, a fraud.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
261,"Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
262,"President Trump, thank you. I'll let you respond, Vice President Harris.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
263,"Well, I think this is so rich.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
264,"Coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault, and his next big court appearance is in",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
265,November at his own criminal sentencing. And let's be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
266,"The former Vice President called for defunding, federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned on 34 felony counts. So let's talk about what is important in this race.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
267,"It is important that we move forward, that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
268,"And address the needs of the American people, address what we need to do about the housing shortage, which I have a plan for. Address what we must do to support our small businesses.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
269,"Address bringing down the price of groceries. But frankly, the American people are exhausted with the same old tired playbook.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
270,"Vice President Harris, thank you.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
271,Excuse me. Every one of those cases was started by them against their political opponent. And I'm winning most of them and I will win the rest on appeal.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
272,"And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court. I'm winning most of 'em. But those are cases, it's called weaponization. Never happened in this country.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
273,"They weaponized the Justice Department. Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fani Willis--to, to the uh Attorney General of New York and the D.A. In New York.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
274,"Every one of those cases. And then they say, ""Oh, he was--he's a criminal."" They're the ones that made them go after me.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
275,"By the way, Joe Biden was found essentially guilty on the documents case. And what happened in my documents case? They said ""Oh, that's the toughest of them all."" A complete and total victory.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
276,Two months ago it was thrown out. It's weaponization. And they used it. And it's never happened in this country. They used it to try and win an election. They're fake cases.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
277,"President Trump, thank you. A really quick response here, Vice President Harris, on this notion of weaponization of the Justice Department.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
278,Well let's talk about extreme. And understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
279,The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former President would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the White House again.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
280,"Understand, this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the Constitution of the United States. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
281,Someone who has openly expressed disdain for members of our military. Understand what it would mean if Donald Trump were back in the White House with no guardrails.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
282,"Because certainly, we know now the Court won't stop him. We know J.D. Vance is not gonna stop him. It's up to the American people to stop him.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
283,"Vice President Harris, thank you. Linsey?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
284,"Vice President Harris, in your last run for president",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
285,This is the one that weaponized. Not me. She weaponized. I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
286,I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy-–,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
287,President Trump--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
288,--with the fake Russia Russia Russia investigation that went nowhere.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
289,We have a lot to get to. Linsey?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
290,"Vice President Harris, in your last run for president you said you wanted to ban fracking. Now you don't. You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons. Now your campaign says you don't.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
291,You supported decriminalizing border crossings. Now you're taking a harder line. I know you say that your values have not changed. So then why have so many of your policy positions changed?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
292,"So, my values have not changed. And I'm going to discuss every one--at least every point that you've made. But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
293,I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
294,"And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
295,My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
296,We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over-rely on foreign oil.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
297,"As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
298,our first home when I was a teenager.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
299,"The values I bring to the importance of home ownership, knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, is a value",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
300,"that I bring to my work, to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
301,by the end of my first term. My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
302,"And my focus then, on protecting women and children from violent crime, is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
303,My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done--protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
304,And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
305,"The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
306,"President Trump, your response.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
307,"Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from 'im.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
308,"But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
309,"So, we don't have to talk about that. Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
310,"And everybody's laughing at it, okay? They're all laughing at it. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
311,That's not true.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
312,"In Minnesota, she went out--wait a minute. I'm talking now. If you don't mind. Please. Does that sound familiar?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
313,Don't lie.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
314,"She went out--she went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get 'em out of jail.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
315,She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
316,"She wants to confiscate your guns and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
317,"Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion: So, I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
318,"They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
319,"I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was, because they had no choice.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
320,"Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
321,"But if she won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
322,"We'll go back to windmills and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar plant?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
323,"By the way, I'm a big fan of solar. But they take 400, 500 acres of desert soil--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
324,President Trump--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
325,--these are not good things for the environment that she understands.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
326,"President Trump, we have a lot of issues that we have to get to. We're out of time. Thank you.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
327,"Linsey, thank you. We have an election in just 56 days.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
328,"An--I want to talk about the peaceful transfer of power, which of course we all know was a cornerstone of our democracy and the role of a president in a moment of crisis. Uh, Mr.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
329,"President, on January 6th you told your supporters to march to the Capitol. You said you would be right there with them.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
330,The country and the world saw what played out at the Capitol that day. The officers coming under attack. Aides in the West Wing say you watched it unfold on television off the Oval Office.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
331,"You did send out tweets, but it was more than two hours before you sent out that video message telling your supporters to go home.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
332,Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
333,"You just said a thing that isn't covered. Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech. Not later on. Peacefully and patriotically. And nobody on the other side was killed.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
334,"Ashli Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace. But we didn't do--this group of people that have been treated so badly.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
335,"I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? That she allowed to pour in. She was the border czar. Remember that. She was the border czar.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
336,"She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border. In fact, she said at the beginning, I'm surprised you're not talking about the border yet.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
337,"That's because she knows what a bad job they've done. What about those people? What's, when are they going to be prosecuted?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
338,"When are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world, David, all over the world.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
339,And crime rates are down all over the world because of it--,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
340,But let me just ask you--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
341,"David. But when are those, David, when are those people going to be prosecuted? When are the people that burned down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted? Or in Seattle?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
342,"They went into Seattle, they took over a big percentage of the city of Seattle. When are those people going to be prosecuted?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
343,But let me just ask you--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
344,You might ask her that question.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
345,You were the President. You were watching it unfold on television. It's a very simple question as we move forward toward another election. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
346,Yes or no.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
347,"I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech. I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
348,"I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
349,"I said, you know, this is gonna be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it. And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
350,"I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
351,"It was just two weeks ago, her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened. They want to get rid of that tape.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
352,It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security. Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
353,"The question was about you as President, not about Former Speaker Pelosi. But I do want Vice President Harris to respond here.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
354,I was at the Capitol on January 6th. I was the Vice President-Elect. I was also an acting senator. I was there.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
355,"And on that day, the President of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's Capitol, to desecrate our nation's Capitol. On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
356,"And some died. And understand, the former President has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
357,"Let's remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the President then at the time say? There were fine people on each side.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
358,"Let's remember that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the President said, the former President said, ""Stand back and stand by."" So for everyone watching who remembers",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
359,"what January 6th was, I say we don't have to go back. Let's not go back. We're not going back. It's time to turn the page.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
360,"And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you. To stand for country. To stand for our democracy. To stand for rule of law.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
361,And to end the chaos. And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy 'cause you don't like the outcome. And be clear on that point.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
362,"Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath, if this--and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let's turn the page on this.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
363,Let's not go back. Let's chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
364,Let me just follow up here--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
365,"--I have said blood-bash--bath. It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business. That was where bloodbath was.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
366,"Also, on Charlottesville, that story has been as you would say, debunked. Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse--all of these people, they covered it. If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
367,"It was debunked in almost every newspaper. But they still bring it up, just like they bring 2025 up. They bring all of this stuff up. I ask you this. You talk about the Capitol.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
368,Why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border? How come she's not doing the--and I'll tell you what I would do.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
369,And I would be very proud to do it.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
370,"I would say we would both leave this debate right now, I'd like to see her go down to Washington, D.C. during this debate 'cause we're wasting a lot of time.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
371,"Go down to--because she's been so bad, it's so ridiculous. Go down to Washington, D.C. And let her sign a bill to close up the border. Because they have the right to do it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
372,"They don't need bills. They have the right to do it. The President of the United States, you'll get him out of bed. You'll wake him up at 4:00 in the afternoon--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
373,Alright--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
374,"--you'll say come on; come on down to the office, let's sign a bill.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
375,"If he--if he signs a bill that the border is closed, all he has to do is say it to the border patrol, who are phenomenal. If they do that, the border is closed.--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
376,Mr. President--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
377,"--Those people are killing many people, unlike J-6.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
378,"We talked immigration here tonight. I do want to focus on this next issue to both of you. Because it really brings us, uh, this into focus.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
379,"Truth, uh, in these times that we're living in. Mr.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
380,"President, for three and a half years after uh you lost the 2020 election you repeatedly, uh, falsely claimed that you won, many times saying you won in a landslide.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
381,"In the past couple of weeks leading up to this debate, you have said, quote, you lost by a whisker, that you, quote, didn't quite make it, that you came up a little bit short.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
382,I said that?,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
383,Are you now acknowledging that you lost in 2020?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
384,"No, I don't acknowledge that at all.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
385,But you did say that.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
386,"I said that sarcastically. You know that. It was said, oh we lost by a whisker. That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
387,And they shoulda sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
388,"I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten. The election, people should never be thinking about an election as fraudulent. We need two things.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
389,We need walls. We need--and we have to have it. We have to have borders. And we have to have good elections. Our elections are bad.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
390,"And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote. They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in practically.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
391,And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that's why they're allowing them to come into our country.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
392,I did watch all of these pieces of video.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
393,"I didn't detect the sarcasm, ""lost by a whisker,"" ""we didn't quite make it,"" and we should just point out as clarification, and you know this, you and your allies,",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
394,60 cases in front of many judges. Many of them--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
395,No judge looked at it.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
396,--and said there was no widespread fraud.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
397,They said we didn't have standing. That's the other thing. They said we didn't have standing. A technicality.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
398,"Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn't have standing, the President of the United States doesn't have standing? That's how we lost.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
399,"If you look at the facts, and I'd love to have you--you'll do a special on it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
400,I'll show you Georgia and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you--we have so many facts and statistics. But you know what? That doesn't matter.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
401,Because we have to solve the problem that we have right now. That's old news.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
402,"And the problem that we have right now is we have a nation in decline, and they have put it into decline. We have a nation that is dying, David.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
403,"Mr. President, thank you. Uh, Vice President Harris, you heard the President there tonight. He said he didn't say that he lost by a whisker.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
404,"So he still believes, uh, he did not lose the election uh, that was won by President Biden uh, and and yourself.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
405,"But I do want to ask you about something that's come up in the last couple of days. This was a post from President Trump about this upcoming election uh, just weeks away.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
406,"He said, ""When I win, those people who cheated,"" and then he lists donors, voters, election officials, he says ""Will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, which",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
407,"will include long-term prison sentences."" One of your campaign's top lawyers responded saying, ""We won't let Donald Trump intimidate us.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
408,"We won't let him suppress the vote."" Is that what you believe he's trying to do here?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
409,"Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. So, let's be clear about that. And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
410,But we cannot afford to have a President of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
411,"And I'm gonna tell you that, uh, I have traveled the world as Vice President of the United States. And world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
412,"I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you. And they say you're a disgrace.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
413,"And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost, because you did in fact",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
414,"lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or, or the ability to not be confused",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
415,about fact. That's deeply troubling. And the American people deserve better.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
416,"I'll give you one minute to respond, Mr. President.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
417,"Okay, let me just tell you about world leaders. Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men--they call him a strong man. He's a, he's a tough person. Smart. Prime Minister of Hungary.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
418,"They said, ""Why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up?"" He said, ""Because you need Trump back as President. They were afraid of him.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
419,"China was afraid."" And I don't like to use the word afraid but I'm just quoting him. ""China was afraid of him.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
420,"North Korea was afraid of him."" Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
421,"He said, ""Russia was afraid of him."" I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one but he ended the XL pipeline. The XL pipeline in our country.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
422,"He ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany. The biggest pipeline in the world. Look, Viktor Orban said it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
423,"He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was President.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
424,"But when this weak, pathetic man that you saw at a debate just a few months ago that if he weren't in that debate he'd be running instead of her,",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
425,"she got no votes, he got 14 million votes, what you did, you talk about a threat to democracy. He got 14 million votes and they threw him out of office. And you know what?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
426,I'll give you a little secret. He hates her. He can't stand her.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
427,Mr. President --,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
428,"But he had 14 million votes. They threw 'im out. She got zero votes. And when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed. And now she's running.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
429,I don't understand it but I'm okay with it-–,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
430,Mr. President--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
431,--because I think we're going to do pretty well.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
432,"Mr. President, your time is up. We've got a lot more to get--to.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
433,"Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war and the hostages who are still being held, Americans among them.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
434,"Vice President Harris, in December you said, ""Israel has a right to defend itself"" but you added, ""It matters how."" Saying, ""International humanitarian law must be respected, Israel must do",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
435,"more to protect innocent civilians."" You said that nine months ago. Now an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are dead. Nearly 100 hostages remain.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
436,Just last week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's not a deal in the making. President Biden has not been able to break through the stalemate. How would you do it?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
437,"Well, let's understand how we got here. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered twelve hundred Israelis. Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert. Women were horribly raped.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
438,"And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
439,"Because it is also true, far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
440,"It must when--end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out. And so we will continue to work around the clock on that.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
441,Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
442,"And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
443,"But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it rates--relates to Iran and any threat that",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
444,"Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
445,"President Trump, how would you negotiate with Netanyahu and also Hamas in order to get the hostages out and prevent the killing of more innocent civilians in Gaza?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
446,"If I were president, it would have never started. If I were president, Russia would have never, ever--I know Putin very well.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
447,"He would have never--and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years--have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
448,Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. But when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden--she hates Israel.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
449,She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
450,"She wanted to go to the sorority party. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. And I've been pretty good at predictions.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
451,And I hope I'm wrong about that one. She hates Israel.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
452,"At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is gonna get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
453,Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
454,Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
455,"It was a big story, and you know it. You covered it. Very well, actually. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
456,And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
457,"I will get that settled and fast. And I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I'm President-Elect, I'll get it done before even becoming President.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
458,"Vice President Harris, he says you hate Israel.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
459,"Heh, well, that's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people. He knows that.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
460,"He's trying to again divide and and distract from the reality, which is it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
461,"It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one according to himself.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
462,It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
463,It is well known that he said when Russia went into Ukraine it was brilliant. It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
464,"And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear, they can manipulate you with flattery and favors.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
465,And that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
466,That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security--,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
467,Vice President Harris--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
468,--including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
469,"Vice President Harris, thank you.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
470,"They're the ones--and she's the one that caused it--that's weak on national security by allowing every nation last month for the year, 168 different countries sending people into our country.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
471,"Their crime rates are way down. Putin endorsed her last week. Said, ""I hope she wins."" And I think he meant it. Because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
472,It wouldn't have happened with me. The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent. And they are. They're grossly incompetent. And I just ask one question.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
473,"Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made, Nordstream 2, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world going",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
474,"to Germany and all over Europe? Because they're weak and they're ineffective. And Biden, by the way--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
475,President Trump--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
476,--gets paid a lot of money --,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
477,Thank you. We have a lot of issues to get to.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
478,We'll be right back with much more of this historic ABC News presidential debate from the National Constitution Center right here in Philadelphia. Back in a moment.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
479,"Welcome back to this historic ABC news presidential debate tonight. We're going to continue here, and I want to turn to the war in Ukraine. We're now 2 1/2 years into this conflict. Mr.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
480,"President, it has been the position of the Biden Administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia, from Vladimir Putin, to defend their sovereignty, their democracy, that it's in America's",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
481,"best interest to do so, arguing that if Putin wins he may be emboldened to move even further into other countries. You have said you would solve this war in 24 hours.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
482,"You said so just before the break tonight. How exactly would you do that? And, and I want to ask you a very simple question tonight. Do you want Ukraine to win this war?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
483,I want the war to stop. I wanna save lives that are being uselessly--people being killed by the millions. It's the millions.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
484,"It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
485,"Look, we're in for 250 billion or more, because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
486,They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
487,"They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not gonna protect you anymore.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
488,So that may be one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what's happening. We're in for 250 to 275 billion.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
489,"They're into 100 to 150. They should be forced to equalize. With that being said, I wanna get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well, and I know Putin very well.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
490,I have a good relationship. And they respect your President. Okay? They respect me. They don't respect Biden. How would you respect him? Why? For what reason?,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
491,He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
492,"I will get it settled before I even become President. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get 'em together.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
493,That war would have never happened.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
494,"And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our--our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers,",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
495,"he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
496,"He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. Don't kid yourself, David.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
497,We're playing with World War 3. And we have a President that we don't even know if he's -- where is our President? We don't even know if he's a President.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
498,And just to clarify here.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
499,"They threw him out of a campaign like a dog. We don't even know, is he our President? But we have a President--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
500,"Mr. President,",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
501,--that doesn't know he's alive.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
502,"Your time is up. Uh, uh,just to clarify the question, do you believe it's in the U.S. best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
503,I think it's in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and f--just get it done.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
504,All right.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
505,Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
506,I want to take this to Vice President Harris. I want to get your thoughts on support for Ukraine in this moment.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
507,"But also as Commander-in-Chief, if elected, how would you deal with Vladimir Putin and would it be any different from what we're seeing from President Biden?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
508,"Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former President you're not runnin' against Joe Biden, you're runnin' against me.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
509,I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that's not who we are as Americans.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
510,Let's understand what happened here.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
511,"Uh, I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried through force to change territorial boundaries, to defy one of the most important international rules and norms,",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
512,which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
513,"Days later I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did, we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
514,"And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
515,"If Donald Trump were President, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean. Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
516,Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer President and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
517,"world has ever known, which is NATO. And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
518,"Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
519,"And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up, for the sake of favor and what you think is a",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
520,"friendship, with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
521,Vice President Harris Thank you. We heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight. Afghanistan came up in the last hour--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
522,I have to respond to her.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
523,-- I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
524,I have to respond.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
525,Please I'll give you a minute here.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
526,"Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women. But he would have been sitting in Moscow",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
527,"Quiet, please. He would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now. But eventually, you know, he's got a thing that other people don't have. He's got nuclear weapons.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
528,They don't ever talk about that. He's got nuclear weapons. Nobody ever thinks about that. And eventually uh maybe he'll use them. Maybe he hasn't been that threatening. But he does have that.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
529,"Something we don't even like to talk about. Nobody likes to talk about it. But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
530,Three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid. They said the wrong things. That war should have never started. She was the emissary.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
531,They sent her in to negotiate with Zelenskyy and Putin. And she did and the war started three days later--,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
532,Vice President--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
533,"--and that's the kind of talent we have with her. She's worse than Biden. In my opinion, I think he's the worst president in the history of our country.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
534,She goes down as the worst Vice President in the history of our country. But let me tell you something. She is a horrible negotiator. They sent her in to negotiate.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
535,As soon as they left Putin did the invasion.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
536,"President Trump, thank you. You did bring up something, you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Vice President Harris, have you ever met Vladimir Putin, can you clarify tonight?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
537,"Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
538,"When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy, I've now met with him over five times.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
539,"The reality is, it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international nul--rules and norms.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
540,"As a leader who shows strength, understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
541,"enemies, because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here. The President of the United States is Commander-in-Chief.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
542,And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
543,ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the--for the benefit of personal flattery.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
544,We've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin. I do want to talk about Afghanistan. It came up in the first hour of this debate.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024

546,"I, I want to move on to Afghanistan--",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
547,"Secretary General Stoltenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen, he got these countries, the 28 countries at the time, to pay up. He said I've never seen--he's the head of NATO.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
548,He said I've never seen--for years we were paying almost all of NATO. We were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
549,"I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, if you don't pay we're not gonna protect you.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
550,President Trump--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
551,Otherwise we would've never gotten it. He said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
552,Thank you. I want to turn to Afghanistan.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
553,"It came up in the first hour of the debate, and we witnessed a, a poignant moment today on Capitol Hill honoring the soldiers who died in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
554,"I do want to ask the Vice President, do you believe you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
555,"Well, I will tell you, I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
556,"And as a result, America's taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
557,"And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world--the first time this century.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
558,But let's understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump when he was President negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a dealmaker.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
559,"Even his National Security Adviser said it was a weak, terrible deal. And here's how it went down. He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
560,"The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists, released. And get this--no, get this. And the President at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
561,"A place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
562,And this former President as President invited them to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
563,Commander in Chief with a level of respect.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
564,"And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
565,the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
566,"Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, your response to her saying that you began the negotiations with the Taliban.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
567,"Yeah, thank you. So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of 'em, with snipers.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
568,And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
569,"They don't bother doing that because you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time. But I got involved. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
570,"He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're gonna have problems.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
571,"And he said, ""Why do you send me a picture of my house?"" I said, ""You're going to have to figure that out, Abdul."" And for 18 months we had nobody killed.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
572,"We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, it was--we were getting out.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
573,"We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
574,"And we wouldn't have left--we wouldn't have left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful military equipment behind. And just to finish, they blew it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
575,"The agreement said you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it. They didn't do it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
576,The agreement was--was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
577,I want to move on.,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
578,"And these people did the worst withdrawal and in my opinion the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And by the way, that's why Russia attacked Ukraine.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
579,Because they saw how incompetent she and her boss are.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
580,"President Trump, thank you. I want to move on now to race and politics in this country. Mr.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
581,"President, you recently said of Vice President Harris, ""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
582,"to be known as Black."" I want to ask a bigger-picture question here tonight. Why do you believe it's appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your opponent?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
583,"I don't. And I don't care. I don't care what she is. I don't care. Uh, you make a big deal out of something. I couldn't care less.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
584,Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
585,"But those were your words. So, I'm asking --",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
586,"I don't know. I don't know. All I can say is I read where she was not Black--that she put out. And, I'll say that. And then I read that she was Black.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
587,And that's okay. Either one was okay with me. That's up to her. That's up to her.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
588,"Vice President Harris, your thoughts on this?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
589,"I think it's, I mean honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be President who has consistently over the course of his career attempted",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
590,"to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
591,"And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. And let's remember how Donald Trump started.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
592,"He was a, a, a—land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
593,"Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
594,"were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
595,"And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
596,We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
597,"I meet with people all the time who tell me ""Can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
598,"dreams of the American people?"" Knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
599,"invests in those, not in hate and division.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
600,Vice President Harris thank you. Linsey?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
601,"President Trump, this is now your third time --",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
602,This is the most divisive presidency in the history of our country. There's never been anything like it. They're destroying our country.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
603,"And they come up with things like what she just said going back many, many years when a lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg agreed with me on the Central Park Five.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
604,"They admitted--they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty--then they pled we're not guilty.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
605,"But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago because there's nothing now.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
606,"I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm gonna build it again. It's going to be bigger, better and stronger. But they're destroying our economy.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
607,"They have no idea what a good economy is. Their oil policies--every single policy--and remember this. She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
608,She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad. And she can't get away with that.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
609,"Mr. President, thank you, your time is up. Linsey --",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
610,"I want to respond to that, though. I want to just respond briefly. Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
611,And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
612,"One who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
613,"I believe in what we can do to strengthen our small businesses, which is why I have a plan. Let's talk about our plans. And, and let's compare the plans.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
614,"I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction, to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
615,"I have a plan. $6,000 for young families for the first year of your child's life. To help you in that most critical stage of your child's development.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
616,"I have a plan that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream, by offering a help with down",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
617,"payment of $25,000, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. That's the kind of conversation I believe, David, that people really want tonight as opposed to a conversation that is constantly about belittling and name-calling.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
618,Let's turn the page and move forward.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
619,"Vice President Harris, thank you. Let's turn to policy--let's turn back to policy.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
620,"President Trump, we have to move on. President Trump --",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
621,She is destroying our country.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
622,"Let's turn to policy, please?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
623,She has a plan to defund the police. She has a flan--plan to confiscate everybody's gun.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
624,President Trump we do have to--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
625,She has a plan to not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. That's what her plan is until just recently.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
626,"President Trump, President Trump.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
627,The former president has said something twice and I need to respond too. I just need to respond one time to what he has said multiple times.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
628,"I'm sorry, we're going to move on, Vice President Harris. This is now your third time running for president. you have long vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
629,"You have failed to accomplish that. You now say you're going to keep Obamacare. Quote, unless we can do something much better. Last month you said, quote, we're working on it.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
630,"So tonight, nine years after you first started running, do you have a plan and can you tell us what it is?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
631,Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It's not very good today.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
632,"And what I said, that if we come up with something, and we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it. But remember this.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
633,I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it. They wouldn't vote for it. They were unanimous. They wouldn't vote to change it.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
634,"If they woulda done that, we woulda had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
635,"I had a choice to make when I was President, do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never gonna be great. Or do I let it rot?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
636,"And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
637,"I decided--and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people--I have a lot of good people in this -- that administration. We read about the bad ones.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
638,We had some real bad ones too. And so do they. They have really bad ones. The difference is they don't get rid of 'em. But let me just explain.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
639,"I had a choice to make do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it. I did the right thing.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
640,But it's still never going to be great. And it's too expensive for people. And what we will do is we're looking at different plans.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
641,"If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
642,"But until then, I'd run it as good as it can be run.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
643,"So just a yes or no, you still do not have a plan?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
644,I have concepts of a plan. I'm not President right now. But if we come up with something I would only change it if we come up with something that's better and less expensive.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
645,And there are concepts and options we we have to do that. And you'll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
646,"Vice president Harris, in 2017 you supported Bernie Sanders' proposal to do away with private insurance and create a government-run health care system.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
647,Two years later you proposed a plan that included a private insurance option. What is your plan today?,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
648,"Well, first of all, I absolutely support and over the last four years as Vice President, private health care options. But what we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
649,"But I, I'll get to that, Linsey. I just need to respond to a previous point that the former President has made. I've made very clear my position on fracking.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
650,And then this business about taking everyone's guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
651,"As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, understand, just look at the history to know where people stand.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
652,"When Donald Trump was president, 60 times he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 60 times. I was a Senator at the time.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
653,"When, I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate and the late great John McCain, who you have",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
654,"disparaged as being--uh, you don't like him, you said at the time, because he got caught, he was an American hero. The late great John McCain, I will never forget that night.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
655,"Walked onto the Senate floor and said no, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
656,And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
657,"I don't have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like?",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
658,"Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes?",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
659,"And thankfully, as I've been Vice President and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
660,"drug prices on behalf of you the American people. Donald Trump said he was gonna allow Medicare to negotiate dr, drug prices. He never did. We did.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
661,"And now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. Since I've been Vice President we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
662,And when I am President we will do that for all people understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
663,"and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not get rid of it--",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
664,Thank you--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
665,--the past is prologue in terms of where Donald Trump stands on that.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
666,I want to move to an issue that's important --,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
667,"She made a mistake. Number one, John McCain fought Obamacare for ten years. But it wasn't only him. It was, all of the Democrats that kept it going. And you know what?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
668,"We could do much better than Obamacare. Much less money. But she won't improve private insurance for people. Private, medical insurance. That's another thing she doesn't want to get.--",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
669,President Trump--,Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
670,--People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they want to have private.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
671,She wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
672,"President Trump, thank you. We have another issue that we'd like to get to that's important for a number of Americans, in particular younger voters, and that's climate change.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
673,"President Trump, with regard to the environment, you say that we have to have clean air and clean water. Vice President Harris, you call climate change an existential threat.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
674,"The question to you both tonight is what would you do to fight climate change? And Vice President Harris, we'll start with you. One minute for you each.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
675,"Well, the former President had said that climate change is a hoax. And what we know is that it is very real.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
676,"You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences, who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
677,"You ask anybody who has been um, the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go. We know that we can actually deal with this issue.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
678,The young people of America care deeply about this issue.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
679,And I am proud that as Vice President over the last four years we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
680,"We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been Vice President. We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
681,Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
682,"And I'm also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Shawn Fain, who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in American-made products, American automobiles.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
683,"It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants, not closing them like happened under Donald Trump.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
684,"Vice President Harris, thank you.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
685,"That didn't happen under Donald Trump. Let me just tell you, they lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month. It's going--they're all leaving. They're building big auto plants in Mexico.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
686,"In many cases owned by China. They're building these massive plants, and they think they're going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
687,What they have given to China is unbelievable. But we're not going to let that. We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
688,"Because they will kill the United Auto Workers and any auto worker, whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place. What they've done to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
689,"We have nothing because they, they refuse--you know, Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid him millions of dollars. He's afraid to do it. Between him and his son.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
690,"They get all this money from Ukraine. They get all this money from all of these different countries. And then you wonder why is he so loyal to this one, that one Ukraine, China?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
691,Why is he? Why did he get 3 1/2 million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Why did he get--why did she pay him 3 1/2 million dollars?,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
692,"This is a crooked administration, and they're selling our country down the tubes.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
693,"President Trump, thank you.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
694,Thank you.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
695,"We'll be right back with closing statements from both of our candidates. An historic night, this ABC News Presidential Debate from Philadelphia. Back in a moment. The time has come for closing statements.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
696,"And Vice President Harris, we begin with you.",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
697,So I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
698,And an attempt to take us backward. But we're not going back.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
699,"And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us, and we can chart a new way forward.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
700,"And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create an",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
701,"opportunity economy, investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hard-working folks a break in",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
702,bringing down the cost of living.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
703,I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring we have the respect that we so rightly deserve including respecting,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
704,our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
705,I will be a President that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
706,"government tell her what to do. I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a D.A. I was an attorney general. A United States Senator. And now Vice President.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
707,"I've only had one client. The people. And I'll tell you, as a prosecutor I never asked a victim or a witness are you a Republican or a Democrat.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
708,"The only thing I ever asked them, are you okay? And that's the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first.",Harris,Philadelphia,2024
709,I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
710,investing right now in you the American people.,Harris,Philadelphia,2024
711,"Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump?",Moderator,Philadelphia,2024
712,"So, she just started by saying she's gonna to do this, she's gonna to do that, she's gonna to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn't she done it?",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
713,She's been there for 3 1/2 years. They've had 3 1/2 years to fix the border. They've had 3 1/2 years to create jobs and all the things we talked about.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
714,"Why hasn't she done it? She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful White House, go to the Capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
715,"But you haven't done it. And you won't do it. Because you believe in things that the American people don't believe in. You believe in things like, we're not going to frack.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
716,"We're not going to take fossil fuel. We're not going to do--things that are going to make this country strong, whether you like it or not.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
717,Germany tried that and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants. We're not ready for it. We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
718,But I just ask one simple question. Why didn't she do it? We're a failing nation. We're a nation that's in serious decline. We're being laughed at all over the world.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
719,"All over the world, they laugh, I know the leaders very well. They're coming to see me. They call me. We're laughed at all over the world.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
720,They don't understand what happened to us as a nation. We're not a leader. We don't have any idea what's going on. We have wars going on in the Middle East.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
721,We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine. We're going to end up in a third World War.,Trump,Philadelphia,2024
722,"And it will be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban.",Trump,Philadelphia,2024
