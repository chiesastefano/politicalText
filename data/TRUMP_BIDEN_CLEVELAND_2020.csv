1,Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
2,I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
3,This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
4,"The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
5,"Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
6,I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
7,"This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the health security advisor to the Commission for all four debates.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
8,"As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
9,"No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
10,"No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
11,"How you doing, man?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
12,How are you doing?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
13,I'm well.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
14,"Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
15,"President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
16,You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the Court.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
17,"Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
18,"My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
19,"President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
20,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
21,"We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
22,"In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
23,"Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
24,She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
25,"We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
26,"And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
27,"And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. The only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
28,"They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
29,"So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
30,"President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
31,"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
32,"Thank you, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
33,The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when,Biden,Cleveland,2020
34,they vote for the President of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
35,Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
36,We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect,Biden,Cleveland,2020
37,"as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
38,"He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
39,"He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
40,"And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
41,"But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
42,"The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
43,They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
44,"And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
45,"Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
46,"If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
47,"There aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
48,"Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time,",Trump,Cleveland,2020
49,"but a President is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-",Trump,Cleveland,2020
50,He's elected to the next election.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
51,"During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
52,"I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180million people with their private health care, that they're very happy with.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
53,That's simply not true.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
54,"Well, you're certainly going to socialist. You're going to socialist medicine-",Trump,Cleveland,2020
55,"Gentlemen, we're now into open discussion.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
56,Open discussion.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
57,"Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
58,"Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
59,"And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
60,They can. They do. They will under my proposal.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
61,That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
62,That is simply a lie.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
63,Your party doesn't say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
64,"The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
65,"And they're going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
66,I am the Democratic Party right now.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
67,Not according to Harris.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
68,"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here's the deal. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
69,"And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
70,What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?,Biden,Cleveland,2020
71,"Joe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don't tell me about this.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
72,I'm happy to talk about this.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
73,"And if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
74,You didn't want me to ban Europe.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
75,"All right, gentlemen, Mr. President.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
76,"You would have been much later, Joe, much later.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
77,Mr. President.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
78,We're talking about two million people.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
79,You're not going to be able to shut him up.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
80,"Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
81,Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
82,"That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
83,You don't know what's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It's not on the ballot.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
84,It's on the ballot in the court.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
85,I don't think so.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
86,In the court.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
87,There's nothing happening there.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
88,Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
89,You don't know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don't know here view.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
90,"Well, all right. All right. Let's talk. We've got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We've got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we'll come back to Roe V. Wade.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
91,All right.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
92,"Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
93,That's right.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
94,You have spent the last week-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
95,Because they want to give good healthcare.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
96,"If I may ask my question, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
97,Good healthcare.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
98,"Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
99,"Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
100,when I finish I'm going to give an opportunity-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
101,"Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
102,That's not a comprehensive place.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
103,That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
104,"I didn't ask, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
105,"Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
106,You're debating him not me. Let me ask my question.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
107,"Well, I'll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
108,Mr. President.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
109,I got rid of it. And we will protect people.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
110,"Mr. President, I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
111,Go ahead.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
112,"You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
113,"Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
114,"Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
115,"I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
116,"You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting healthcare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
117,What about pre-existing conditions?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
118,All of the things that we've done.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
119,He has not done healthcare.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
120,"I'll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
121,Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
122,"Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
123,"Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
124,This is big stuff.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
125,"Sir, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
126,Yes.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
127,And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
128,It is not.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
129,If I start asking the question.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
130,"That's not what your party says, by the way.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
131,And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
132,"It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
133,Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
134,"Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
135,"Look, hey.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
136,Are you saying you didn't agree?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
137,I'm not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
138,Not by much.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
139,I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
140,Not by much.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
141,"I'm here standing facing you, old buddy.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
142,If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
143,All he knows how to do-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
144,"On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
145,Look he's the deal. I got very lucky. I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
146,With what?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
147,And tonight I'm going to make sure.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
148,With what?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
149,"Because here's the deal, here's the deal. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
150,"But you agree. Joe, you're the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
151,"God, I want to make sure-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
152,"Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
153,"No, he doesn't know how to do that.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
154,"You'd be surprised. You'd be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
155,"The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
156,"Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
157,"There is no manifesto, number one.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
158,"Please let him speak, Mr. President.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
159,Number two.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
160,He just lost the left.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
161,Number two.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
162,"You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan , they call it socialized medicine.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
163,Mr. President.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
164,"I'll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
165,"Who is, Bernie?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
166,"Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
167,"Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won't ever look you in the eye and say that's what he wants to do.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
168,Take it away.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
169,"No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
170,He doesn't know how. He doesn't know how to do that.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
171,I've already fixed it.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
172,He has never offered a plan.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
173,"We've already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
174,"Gentlemen, you realize if you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
175,"Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
176,"Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed ... They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
177,"If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
178,"I said, ""You've got to run it so well."" And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
179,"Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
180,"I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
181,Go ahead.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
182,"Please let the Vice President talk, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
183,Good.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
184,He has no plan for healthcare.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
185,"Of course, we do.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
186,Please.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
187,He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He's been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
188,"He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. .",Biden,Cleveland,2020
189,"All right, I have one final question for you.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
190,Sure.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
191,Mr.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
192,"Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
193,"filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn't brought up by the President.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
194,It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
195,"So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
196,either ending the filibuster or packing the court?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
197,"Whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're voting now.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
198,Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
199,Are you going to pack the court?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
200,Vote now.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
201,Are you going to pack the court?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
202,"Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
203,He doesn't want to answer the question.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
204,I'm not going to answer the question.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
205,Why wouldn't you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
206,"Will you shut up, man?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
207,"Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who's on your list?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
208,"Gentlemen, I think we've ended this-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
209,This is so un-Presidential.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
210,He's going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
211,We have ended the segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
212,"That was really a productive segment, wasn't it? Keep yapping, man.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
213,"The people understand, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
214,They sure do.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
215,"47 years, you've done nothing. They're understand.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
216,"All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
217,"We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
218,"Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
219,"My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
220,"the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
221,"Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
222,"In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
223,"When he was presented with that number, he said, ""It is what it is."" Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That's why it is. The President has no plan.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
224,He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do?,Biden,Cleveland,2020
225,He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic. He panicked.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
226,"In addition to that, what did he do?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
227,He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
228,He did not even ask Xi to do that.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
229,Wrong.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
230,He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
231,He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
232,Wrong.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
233,"Sir, it's his two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020

237,Open schools cost a lot of money.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
238,You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and,Biden,Cleveland,2020
239,Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
240,"So, if we would have listened to you.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
241,"Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
242,"If we would've listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
243,"It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
244,"You don't know how many people died in Russia. You don't know how many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
245,"But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, ""He's xenophobic. He's a racist and he's xenophobic,"" because you didn't think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
246,"Sir, it's his two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
247,"You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

249,"The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, ""President Trump did a phenomenal job."" We did.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
250,We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
251,Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
252,"The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It's just fake news.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
253,"They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don't care. I've gotten used to it.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

259,"Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
260,"And there was no one ... We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
261,How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID?,Biden,Cleveland,2020
262,"How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up",Biden,Cleveland,2020

266,"And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask.",Biden,Cleveland,2020

268,What we trust is a scientist.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
269,"You don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
270,"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I'm going to ask.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
271,"Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
272,"The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
273,"You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
274,"Well, I've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
275,God.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
276,"It is a very political thing. I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
277,"They can go faster than that by a lot. It's become very political because the left... Or I don't know if I call them left, I don't know what I call them.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
278,"So you're suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
279,"I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
280,I had him in my office two days ago.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
281,"He talked about the summer, sir, before it's generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
282,Because he said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
283,"I'm talking about when it's generally available, not-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
284,"Well, we're going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
285,They're going to be delivering-,Trump,Cleveland,2020
286,This is the same man who told you-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
287,It's all set up.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
288,"... by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it'd be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
289,"And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
290,"That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
291,So here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
292,"Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of",Biden,Cleveland,2020
293,"the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
294,"Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
295,You'll have the vaccine sooner than that.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
296,"I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
297,"Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, ""Will be muzzled, will be suppressed."" Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
298,"about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
299,No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
300,But you're saying you can't-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
301,Everybody knows-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
302,Or Senator Harris is saying you can't trust the scientist.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
303,"Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn't say that. You can trust the-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
304,"She said that public health experts quote, ""Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.""",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
305,"Yes. Well, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
306,They're the people... And by the way-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
307,We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-,Trump,Cleveland,2020
308,By the way-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
309,... they will have the vaccine very soon.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
310,Let him finish.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
311,Do you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue relating to COVID?,Biden,Cleveland,2020
312,"He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record as saying it.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
313,He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what?,Biden,Cleveland,2020
314,"A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
315,Mr. President?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
316,"Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
317,You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me. Don't ever use that word.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
318,"Oh, give me a break.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
319,"Because you know what? There's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you've done nothing.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
320,"Well, let's have this debate-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
321,"Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

323,"We'll get to the economy in the next segment, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
324,Okay. It's going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.,Trump,Cleveland,2020

327,is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
328,"Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
329,"Because he doesn't have a plan. If I were running it, I'd know what the plan is.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
330,"You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
331,Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
332,Will he just shush for a minute?,Biden,Cleveland,2020

334,"Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
335,Think about it.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
336,"You probably play more than I do, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
337,What about this question of reopenings and the fact-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
338,"Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-",Trump,Cleveland,2020
339,You just admitted you'd shut it down.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
340,"Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
341,"We had to, because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now we've found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
342,"Young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
343,"If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because",Trump,Cleveland,2020
344,they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
345,All right. I want to move onto another-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
346,Because it's a political thing.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
347,I want to move onto another subject.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
348,I got to respond to that.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
349,I want to move-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020

355,"President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
356,Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
357,"No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look... I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

378,I'm okay with masks. I'm not fighting masks.,Trump,Cleveland,2020

381,Outside.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
382,"Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020

386,"All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020

399,All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020

411,"President Trump, in this segment you go first.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
412,"So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

418,"And I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, ""Oh, we're going to open up on November 9th."" Why November 9th?",Trump,Cleveland,2020

957,Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayer's money. That report was written for political reason.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
958,I'd like to talk about climate change.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
959,So would I.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
960,"Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change, Mr.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020

979,"But sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed...?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
980,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
981,Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
982,"Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive, and it's a much safer car, and you're talk it about a tiny difference.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

984,"We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
985,But in the case of California they have simply ignored your rollback.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
986,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way, we're going to see how that turns out.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
987,"But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
988,OK. . .,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
989,And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars. I've given big incentives for electric cars but what they've done in California is just crazy.,Trump,Cleveland,2020

1154,No. But what I'm saying is . . .,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1155,. . . like they used to in the old. . .,Trump,Cleveland,2020
1156,. . . what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people. . .,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1157,"You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in, they're sending it back and you're sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what's going on?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
1158,"Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
1159,There is no--there is no evidence of that. . .,Biden,Cleveland,2020

1164,"Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you. It's sent to your home.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1165,"What we're saying is, they're saying is that it has to be a postmark by the time, by election day. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1166,He's just afraid of counting the votes because. . . .,Biden,Cleveland,2020

1170,"Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that-",Trump,Cleveland,2020
1171,"No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1172,"It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity,. . .",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1173,That could be fraud.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
1174,". . .or they missed the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1175,"I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here's the deal. When you file—when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1176,"If you didn't know, you have someone say that, this is me.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1177,"You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that's you when, before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because",Biden,Cleveland,2020

1188,"That means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1189,It could be weeks. . .,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1190,Could be months.,Trump,Cleveland,2020

1195,"As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They're called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
1196,"You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people. I hope it's going to be a fair election.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
1197,If it's a fair election. . .,Trump,Cleveland,2020
1198,You're urging them what?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
1199,". . . I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that. And I'll tell you what. . .",Trump,Cleveland,2020

1212,"Yes. And here's the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1213,"And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military--they've been voting by ballots for since the end of the Civil War, in effect.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1214,"And that's, and that's what's going to happen. Why was it not, why is it for them, somehow not fraudulent. It's the same process. It's honest.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1215,"No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that the, somehow it's a fraudulent process.",Biden,Cleveland,2020

1220,"He has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1221,"Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
1222,"And if it's me, in fact, fine. If it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
