1,"Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the health security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
2,"How you doing, man?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
3,How are you doing?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
4,I'm well.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
5,"Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
6,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. The only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
7,"President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
8,"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
9,"Thank you, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
10,"The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
11,"There aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-",Trump,Cleveland,2020
12,He's elected to the next election.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
13,"During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180million people with their private health care, that they're very happy with.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
14,That's simply not true.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
15,"Well, you're certainly going to socialist. You're going to socialist medicine-",Trump,Cleveland,2020
16,"Gentlemen, we're now into open discussion.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
17,Open discussion.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
18,"Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
19,"Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
20,That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
21,That is simply a lie.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
22,Your party doesn't say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
23,"The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
24,"And they're going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
25,I am the Democratic Party right now.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
26,Not according to Harris.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
27,"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here's the deal. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
28,"Joe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don't tell me about this.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
29,I'm happy to talk about this.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
30,"And if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban Europe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
31,"All right, gentlemen, Mr. President.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
32,"You would have been much later, Joe, much later.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
33,Mr. President.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
34,We're talking about two million people.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
35,You're not going to be able to shut him up.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
36,"Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
37,"Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
38,You don't know what's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It's not on the ballot.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
39,It's on the ballot in the court.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
40,I don't think so.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
41,In the court.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
42,There's nothing happening there.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
43,Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
44,You don't know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don't know here view.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
45,"Well, all right. All right. Let's talk. We've got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We've got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we'll come back to Roe V. Wade.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
46,All right.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
47,"Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
48,That's right.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
49,You have spent the last week-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
50,Because they want to give good healthcare.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
51,"If I may ask my question, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
52,Good healthcare.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
53,"Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
54,"Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
55,when I finish I'm going to give an opportunity-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
56,"Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
57,That's not a comprehensive place.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
58,That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
59,"I didn't ask, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
60,"Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
61,You're debating him not me. Let me ask my question.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
62,"Well, I'll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
63,Mr. President.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
64,I got rid of it. And we will protect people.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
65,"Mr. President, I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
66,Go ahead.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
67,"You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
68,"Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting healthcare.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
69,What about pre-existing conditions?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
70,All of the things that we've done.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
71,He has not done healthcare.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
72,"I'll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
73,"Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
74,This is big stuff.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
75,"Sir, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
76,Yes.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
77,And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
78,It is not.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
79,If I start asking the question.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
80,"That's not what your party says, by the way.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
81,And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
82,"It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
83,"Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
84,"Look, hey.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
85,Are you saying you didn't agree?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
86,I'm not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
87,Not by much.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
88,I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
89,Not by much.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
90,"I'm here standing facing you, old buddy.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
91,If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
92,All he knows how to do-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
93,"On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
94,Look he's the deal. I got very lucky. I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
95,With what?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
96,And tonight I'm going to make sure.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
97,With what?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
98,"Because here's the deal, here's the deal. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
99,"But you agree. Joe, you're the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
100,"God, I want to make sure-",Biden,Cleveland,2020
101,"Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
102,"No, he doesn't know how to do that.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
103,"You'd be surprised. You'd be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
104,"The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
105,"Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
106,"There is no manifesto, number one.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
107,"Please let him speak, Mr. President.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
108,Number two.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
109,He just lost the left.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
110,Number two.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
111,"You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan , they call it socialized medicine.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
112,Mr. President.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
113,"I'll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
114,"Who is, Bernie?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
115,"Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won't ever look you in the eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
116,"No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
117,He doesn't know how. He doesn't know how to do that.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
118,I've already fixed it.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
119,He has never offered a plan.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
120,"We've already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
121,"Gentlemen, you realize if you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
122,"Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed ... They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, ""You've got to run it so well."" And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
123,"I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
124,Go ahead.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
125,"Please let the Vice President talk, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
126,Good.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
127,He has no plan for healthcare.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
128,"Of course, we do.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
129,Please.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
130,"He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He's been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. .",Biden,Cleveland,2020
131,"All right, I have one final question for you.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
132,Sure.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
133,"Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn't brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
134,"Whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
135,Are you going to pack the court?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
136,Vote now.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
137,Are you going to pack the court?,Trump,Cleveland,2020
138,"Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
139,He doesn't want to answer the question.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
140,I'm not going to answer the question.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
141,Why wouldn't you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
142,"Will you shut up, man?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
143,"Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who's on your list?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
144,"Gentlemen, I think we've ended this-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
145,This is so un-Presidential.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
146,He's going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
147,We have ended the segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
148,"That was really a productive segment, wasn't it? Keep yapping, man.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
149,"The people understand, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
150,They sure do.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
151,"47 years, you've done nothing. They're understand.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
152,"All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
153,"Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, ""It is what it is."" Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That's why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?",Biden,Cleveland,2020
154,He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
155,Wrong.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
156,He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
157,Wrong.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
158,"Sir, it's his two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
159,It's so wrong.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
160,"I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
161,"So, if we would have listened to you.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
162,"Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
163,"If we would've listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China. You don't know how many people died in Russia. You don't know how many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, ""He's xenophobic. He's a racist and he's xenophobic,"" because you didn't think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
164,"Sir, it's his two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
165,"You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, ""President Trump saved thousands of lives."" Many of your Democrat Governors said, ""President Trump did a phenomenal job."" We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, ""President Trump did a phenomenal job."" We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
166,"The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could've never done that, Joe.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
167,I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
168,"Well, you didn't do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
169,"14,000 people died, not 200,000.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
170,"A far less lethal disease, by the way.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
171,"Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
172,"And there was no one ... We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?",Biden,Cleveland,2020

174,"His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask.

175,"You don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?",Trump,Cleveland,2020
176,"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
177,"Well, I've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
178,God.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
179,"It is a very political thing. I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It's become very political because the left... Or I don't know if I call them left, I don't know what I call them.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
180,"So you're suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
181,"I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
182,"He talked about the summer, sir, before it's generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020

189,"That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
190,"So here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.",Biden,Cleveland,2020

192,You'll have the vaccine sooner than that.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
193,"I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, ""Will be muzzled, will be suppressed."" Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
194,No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.,Biden,Cleveland,2020

He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what?

214,"Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
215,"Because he doesn't have a plan. If I were running it, I'd know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-",Biden,Cleveland,2020

224,"Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now we've found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance.

If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I'll tell you what, you'll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave.

In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I'm going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I, I think that the country would be better served, sir, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020

483,He does plenty.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
484,"No, less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of race. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
485,"Oh yeah, sure.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
486,"President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
487,That's true.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
488,"My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
489,"It's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require, acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people. . . Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, spewting--just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed, and they asked the president what he thought. He said, ""There were very fine people on both sides."" No president's ever said anything like that. .",Biden,Cleveland,2020
490,It is his-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
491,Now-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
492,... minute sir.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
493,"... second point I'd make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said ""All he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all."" This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division. This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man, this man is a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man's done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he's talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
494,So-,Trump,Cleveland,2020
495,"President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race issues?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
496,"You did a crime bill, 1994, where you called them super-predators. African-Americans are super-predators and they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
497,I've never said-,Biden,Cleveland,2020
498,"No, no, sir. It's his two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
499,"So you did that, and they call you super-predator and I'm letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990--and that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super-predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200--250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every... Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, ""I support President Trump."" I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it, because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don't. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
500,"All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, ""Whether justice could be equally applied in America."" Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
501,"Yes, there is. There's systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do as President of the United States is call a, a, together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when--and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.",Biden,Cleveland,2020
502,"All right, Mr.-",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
503,What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-,Trump,Cleveland,2020
504,President Trump-,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
505,... and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- .,Trump,Cleveland,2020

507,"No it's not, but you say it is.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
508,I did not say it is.,Biden,Cleveland,2020
509,"President Trump, I'd like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we're going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
510,Fine.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
511,"This month, your Administration, uh, directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
512,"I ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it, oh it's totally racial.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
513,What is radical about racial sensitivity training?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
514,"If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And, and really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It's a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country.

521,Let him finish.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
522,"The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, uh, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important that people know. Many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings. But it's amazing, it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self-sense, a sense of self-esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and, and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, and grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're gonna bring this country together is bring everybody together. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together.

As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding, in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down, it didn't go up. It went down.

In Portland, Oregon, especially we had a, more than a hundred straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-President you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have, though, is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, ""Hey, you gotta stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland.""",Moderator,Cleveland,2020

When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but Vice-President Biden, you'd like to quote one of your dad's sayings, which is don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I'm going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent? In this segment, President Trump you'll go first, two minutes.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
636,"Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years. And that's despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I hadda fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest employ--unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going. And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling, and they were saying it's time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him. Three hundred and eight thousand people died because they didn't have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. The job that we've done. . . and, and I'll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important. By the end of the first term, I'll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300, and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record the likes of which very few people. . . and you know, one of the reasons I'll have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say, if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president. You can't be a good Vice-President but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

682,"Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said, ""I don't think the science knows."" Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
683,"I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon. If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren't put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on, because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You've got to have forest management.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
684,"What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
685,"I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water, and do whatever else we can that's good. You know, we're planting a billion trees--the Billion Tree Project--and it's very exciting for a lot of people.",Trump,Cleveland,2020

687,"I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forests. Every year I get the call. California's burning, California's burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know, in Europe, they live their forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city. He said, ""Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn't be that problem."" I spoke with the Governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor. But I said, ""At some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.""",Trump,Cleveland,2020

691,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
692,Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
693,"Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive, and it's a much safer car, and you're talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.",Trump,Cleveland,2020
694,But in the case of California they have simply ignored your rollback.,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
695,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way, we're going to see how that turns out.

696,OK. . .,Moderator,Cleveland,2020
697,And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars. I've given big incentives for electric cars but what they've done in California is just crazy.,Trump,Cleveland,2020
698,"All right, Vice president Biden. I'd like you to respond to the president's climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035, and zero net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
699,"He's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when, during our Administration in the Recovery Act, I was able, was in charge, able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody's gonna build another, uh, coal fired plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire plant in America. They're going to move to renewable energy, number one, Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on, that're electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500,000 charging stations and all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will --they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. Creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no, no relationship to, with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the comp--countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars, and say, ""Here's $20 billion. Stop, stop tearing, tearing down the forest. And if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences.""",Biden,Cleveland,2020

How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some ballots--mail-in ballots--after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
783,"Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com. Decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote, and what means by which they're going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida. Number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to conf--to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you. Because you will—he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not, when the votes are counted and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that'll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he's not sure what he's going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter, because if we get the votes, it's going to be all over. He's gonna go. He can't stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is gonna look like the next four years.

785,"So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught 'em. We've caught 'em all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught 'em all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew about it too. So don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You're soliciting. You're asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited--they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found 'em in creeks. They found some, with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump, just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice. On November 3rd, you're watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we're going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done. But you know what? We won't know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They're losing 30 and 40%. It's a fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, uh, ""You have to have your ballot in by November 10th."" November 10th.

Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?",Moderator,Cleveland,2020
795,"Yeah. I think I'm counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I don't think—I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself.
