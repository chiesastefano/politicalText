1,"A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
2,"The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
3,"After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
4,"The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
5,"And we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
6,"More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
7,"So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
8,"So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China.",Trump,Nashville,2020
9,"It's a worldwide pandemic. It's all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%.",Trump,Nashville,2020
10,"The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike.",Trump,Nashville,2020
11,"There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone.",Trump,Nashville,2020
12,"And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready.",Trump,Nashville,2020
13,"It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine.",Trump,Nashville,2020
14,"I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it.",Trump,Nashville,2020
15,"And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure.",Trump,Nashville,2020
16,But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune.,Trump,Nashville,2020
17,"Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem.",Trump,Nashville,2020
18,"This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look",Trump,Nashville,2020
19,"at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators.",Trump,Nashville,2020
20,"All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.",Trump,Nashville,2020
21,"OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
22,"220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this.",Biden,Nashville,2020
23,"Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as",Biden,Nashville,2020
24,"President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day.",Biden,Nashville,2020
25,"Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate.",Biden,Nashville,2020
26,"The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year.",Biden,Nashville,2020
27,"If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan.",Biden,Nashville,2020
28,"No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time.",Biden,Nashville,2020
29,"I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing.",Biden,Nashville,2020
30,"I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the",Biden,Nashville,2020
31,wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that.,Biden,Nashville,2020
32,"We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever",Biden,Nashville,2020
33,"that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic.",Biden,Nashville,2020
34,"And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.",Biden,Nashville,2020
35,"President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
36,Is that a guarantee?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
37,"It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance.",Trump,Nashville,2020
38,"One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.",Trump,Nashville,2020
39,Can you tell us what companies?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
40,"Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others.",Trump,Nashville,2020
41,"And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.",Trump,Nashville,2020
42,"Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
43,"Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
44,Is your timeline realistic?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
45,"No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate.",Trump,Nashville,2020
46,"I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics.",Trump,Nashville,2020
47,And this is a very easy distribution for him.,Trump,Nashville,2020
48,"He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.",Trump,Nashville,2020
49,"Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
50,What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
51,"Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes.",Biden,Nashville,2020
52,"And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time.",Biden,Nashville,2020
53,"This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer.",Biden,Nashville,2020
54,"We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for",Biden,Nashville,2020
55,the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.,Biden,Nashville,2020
56,"President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
57,"I don't think it's going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning.",Trump,Nashville,2020
58,"When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon.",Trump,Nashville,2020
59,"Now he's saying, 'Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.' But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me.",Trump,Nashville,2020
60,"And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster.",Trump,Nashville,2020
61,"Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease.",Trump,Nashville,2020
62,"Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said 'It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we",Trump,Nashville,2020
63,were doing.' Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this.,Trump,Nashville,2020
64,"Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.",Trump,Nashville,2020
65,"Vice President Biden, your response?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
66,"My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that.",Biden,Nashville,2020
67,"In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was.",Biden,Nashville,2020
68,"What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude.",Biden,Nashville,2020
69,"We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people.",Biden,Nashville,2020
70,"And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, 'Oh, don't worry.",Biden,Nashville,2020
71,"This is all going to be over soon.' Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it's going to be over soon.",Biden,Nashville,2020
72,"President Trump, your reaction?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
73,I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does.,Trump,Nashville,2020
74,"He has the ability to lock himself up. I don't know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can't do that.",Trump,Nashville,2020
75,"By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that.",Trump,Nashville,2020
76,I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that.,Trump,Nashville,2020
77,"And here's — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting",Trump,Nashville,2020
78,"I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it.",Trump,Nashville,2020
79,"And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover.",Trump,Nashville,2020
80,"We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.",Trump,Nashville,2020
81,"And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
82,Can I respond to that?,Biden,Nashville,2020
83,"30 seconds please, and then I have a question.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
84,"Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning.",Biden,Nashville,2020
85,"That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on.",Biden,Nashville,2020
86,"We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now?",Biden,Nashville,2020
87,"What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.",Biden,Nashville,2020
88,Let me talk about —,Moderator,Nashville,2020
89,Excuse me.,Trump,Nashville,2020
90,Very quickly.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
91,"I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault.",Trump,Nashville,2020
92,"They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves.",Trump,Nashville,2020
93,"Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
94,"The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say?",Biden,Nashville,2020
95,"He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it's going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather.",Biden,Nashville,2020
96,"Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said.",Biden,Nashville,2020
97,"And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people",Biden,Nashville,2020
98,President Trump.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
99,"Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months.",Trump,Nashville,2020
100,"What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You're xenophobic.",Trump,Nashville,2020
101,"I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —",Trump,Nashville,2020
102,I didn't say either of those things.,Biden,Nashville,2020
103,You certainly did.,Trump,Nashville,2020
104,I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.,Biden,Nashville,2020
105,"All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
106,He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That's obvious.,Trump,Nashville,2020
107,"Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
108,No.,Biden,Nashville,2020
109,"OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
110,"What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs",Moderator,Nashville,2020
111,the risk of exposure to the virus?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
112,"What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country.",Biden,Nashville,2020
113,"It's his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have",Biden,Nashville,2020
114,lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real.,Biden,Nashville,2020
115,That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of,Biden,Nashville,2020
116,the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.,Biden,Nashville,2020
117,You haven't ruled out more shutdowns,Moderator,Nashville,2020
118,"Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards.",Biden,Nashville,2020
119,"The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums.",Biden,Nashville,2020
120,"Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely.",Biden,Nashville,2020
121,"For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open.",Biden,Nashville,2020
122,"They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now",Biden,Nashville,2020
123,Let's talk about schools. President Trump —,Moderator,Nashville,2020
124,"Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.",Trump,Nashville,2020
125,"Please, and then I have a follow up.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
126,"Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him.",Trump,Nashville,2020
127,"His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying.",Trump,Nashville,2020
128,"They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools.",Trump,Nashville,2020
129,"And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away.",Trump,Nashville,2020
130,"Young people, I guess it's their immune system.",Trump,Nashville,2020
131,"Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
132,"But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
133,"What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
134,"I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country.",Trump,Nashville,2020
135,"You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide.",Trump,Nashville,2020
136,"There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country.",Trump,Nashville,2020
137,"You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down.",Trump,Nashville,2020
138,"He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.",Trump,Nashville,2020
139,"Vice President Biden, your —",Moderator,Nashville,2020
140,"Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open.",Biden,Nashville,2020
141,"You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business.",Biden,Nashville,2020
142,"You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another.",Biden,Nashville,2020
143,"You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace.",Biden,Nashville,2020
144,You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely.,Biden,Nashville,2020
145,"And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.",Biden,Nashville,2020
146,"President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
147,"I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town.",Trump,Nashville,2020
148,"And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer.",Trump,Nashville,2020
149,"I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic?",Trump,Nashville,2020
150,"These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it.",Trump,Nashville,2020
151,It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.,Trump,Nashville,2020
152,Vice President.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
153,"Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying.",Biden,Nashville,2020
154,"And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They're all the United States.",Biden,Nashville,2020
155,And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They're the red states.,Biden,Nashville,2020
156,"They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans.",Biden,Nashville,2020
157,"They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that.",Biden,Nashville,2020
158,It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.,Biden,Nashville,2020
159,"New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.",Trump,Nashville,2020
160,"President Trump, what about —",Moderator,Nashville,2020
161,"When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed.",Trump,Nashville,2020
162,"Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional.",Trump,Nashville,2020
163,"Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen.",Trump,Nashville,2020
164,"We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with",Trump,Nashville,2020
165,"heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.",Trump,Nashville,2020
166,"Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
167,"Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, ""a disaster."" You described him and other medical experts as ""idiots."" If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
168,"I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony.",Trump,Nashville,2020
169,"But he did say, 'don't wear masks.' He did say, as you know, 'this is not going to be a problem.' I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay.",Trump,Nashville,2020
170,"He said, 'this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.' When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others.",Trump,Nashville,2020
171,"And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was.",Trump,Nashville,2020
172,"We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, 'don't wear masks.' Now he wants to wear masks.",Trump,Nashville,2020
173,"Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here's his exact words: 'This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.' So he's allowed to make mistakes,",Trump,Nashville,2020
174,he happens to be a good person.,Trump,Nashville,2020
175,"Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
176,My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people.,Biden,Nashville,2020
177,"He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu.",Biden,Nashville,2020
178,"He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want",Biden,Nashville,2020
179,to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked.,Biden,Nashville,2020
180,"Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, 'this is",Biden,Nashville,2020
181,"a really dangerous thing,' and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, 'sell short, because we gotta",Biden,Nashville,2020
182,get moving. It's a dangerous problem.',Biden,Nashville,2020
183,Well this is —,Trump,Nashville,2020
184,I'm going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
185,"I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money.",Trump,Nashville,2020
186,"And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money.",Trump,Nashville,2020
187,"As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record.",Trump,Nashville,2020
188,But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street.,Trump,Nashville,2020
189,"Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money.",Trump,Nashville,2020
190,"In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don't tell me about wall street.",Trump,Nashville,2020
191,"All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
192,"Average contribution, $43.",Biden,Nashville,2020
193,"All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
194,"Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
195,"Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
196,"Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
197,"I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price.",Biden,Nashville,2020
198,"They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved.",Biden,Nashville,2020
199,"China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now.",Biden,Nashville,2020
200,"They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot.",Biden,Nashville,2020
201,"I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians.",Biden,Nashville,2020
202,"My guess is he'd probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks.",Biden,Nashville,2020
203,We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election.,Biden,Nashville,2020
204,"His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn.",Biden,Nashville,2020
205,"He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens.",Biden,Nashville,2020
206,And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United,Biden,Nashville,2020
207,"States because they know I know them, and they know me.",Biden,Nashville,2020
208,"I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are",Biden,Nashville,2020
209,trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done?,Biden,Nashville,2020
210,"Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.",Biden,Nashville,2020
211,"President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
212,"What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
213,"Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia.",Trump,Nashville,2020
214,"And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow's wife. He got three and a half million dollars.",Trump,Nashville,2020
215,"Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia.",Trump,Nashville,2020
216,I don't get money from Russia.,Trump,Nashville,2020
217,"Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing",Trump,Nashville,2020
218,"that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia.",Trump,Nashville,2020
219,Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO.,Trump,Nashville,2020
220,"You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia.",Trump,Nashville,2020
221,"I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad.",Trump,Nashville,2020
222,"They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine.",Trump,Nashville,2020
223,You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia.,Trump,Nashville,2020
224,"They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible.",Trump,Nashville,2020
225,"The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened.",Trump,Nashville,2020
226,And I think you owe an explanation to the American people.,Trump,Nashville,2020
227,"Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning.",Trump,Nashville,2020
228,"And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.",Trump,Nashville,2020
229,"Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
230,I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.,Biden,Nashville,2020
231,"We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money?",Biden,Nashville,2020
232,"I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years.",Biden,Nashville,2020
233,Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling?,Biden,Nashville,2020
234,"The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world.",Biden,Nashville,2020
235,And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?,Biden,Nashville,2020
236,"President Trump, your response.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
237,"First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can.",Trump,Nashville,2020
238,"I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750.",Trump,Nashville,2020
239,"I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years.",Trump,Nashville,2020
240,"Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.",Trump,Nashville,2020
241,Did your accountant tell you —,Moderator,Nashville,2020
242,"Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee.",Trump,Nashville,2020
243,"But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do.",Trump,Nashville,2020
244,"I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man.",Trump,Nashville,2020
245,"You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man.",Trump,Nashville,2020
246,"Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.",Trump,Nashville,2020
247,"All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
248,You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
249,Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
250,"I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly.",Trump,Nashville,2020
251,"We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done.",Trump,Nashville,2020
252,"As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance.",Trump,Nashville,2020
253,It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.,Trump,Nashville,2020
254,I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
255,At some point I want to respond.,Biden,Nashville,2020
256,"Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
257,"Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You've been saying for four years you're going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr.",Biden,Nashville,2020
258,"President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low.",Biden,Nashville,2020
259,"When last time he said what he paid, he said, 'I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.' Come on, come on, folks.",Biden,Nashville,2020
260,"Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
261,I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through.,Trump,Nashville,2020
262,"Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million.",Trump,Nashville,2020
263,"They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million.",Trump,Nashville,2020
264,"I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that",Trump,Nashville,2020
265,"your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe.",Trump,Nashville,2020
266,And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.,Trump,Nashville,2020
267,"All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
268,"Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
269,"In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
270,Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal.,Biden,Nashville,2020
271,"With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong.",Biden,Nashville,2020
272,"Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy.",Biden,Nashville,2020
273,"Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one.",Biden,Nashville,2020
274,"Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do,",Biden,Nashville,2020
275,"and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it.",Biden,Nashville,2020
276,The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He's the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.,Biden,Nashville,2020
277,Let me ask my question to you.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
278,Could I just — one thing.,Trump,Nashville,2020
279,Very quickly.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
280,"His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job.",Trump,Nashville,2020
281,"As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month.",Trump,Nashville,2020
282,"Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That's 100% dishonest.",Trump,Nashville,2020
283,I'm going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
284,"No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.",Biden,Nashville,2020
285,"OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
286,"A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
287,"I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business.",Trump,Nashville,2020
288,"The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened.",Trump,Nashville,2020
289,"It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other",Trump,Nashville,2020
290,"people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.",Trump,Nashville,2020
291,OK.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
292,"Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before.",Trump,Nashville,2020
293,"So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference.",Trump,Nashville,2020
294,"He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —",Trump,Nashville,2020
295,"We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
296,"There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
297,"If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
298,"What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down.",Biden,Nashville,2020
299,"We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%.",Biden,Nashville,2020
300,"We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well.",Biden,Nashville,2020
301,"When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said 'we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.'",Biden,Nashville,2020
302,"I said, 'we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.' They have to play by the rules, and what's he do?",Biden,Nashville,2020
303,"He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all",Biden,Nashville,2020
304,"our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we' re 25%. 25% of the world's economy.",Biden,Nashville,2020
305,"We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules.",Biden,Nashville,2020
306,"You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it.",Biden,Nashville,2020
307,And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.,Biden,Nashville,2020
308,"All right, let's talk about North Korea.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
309,"Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.",Trump,Nashville,2020
310,"OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...",Moderator,Nashville,2020
311,His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —,Trump,Nashville,2020
312,Not true.,Biden,Nashville,2020
313,"— after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.",Trump,Nashville,2020
314,That is not true.,Biden,Nashville,2020
315,"President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
316,"First of all, China is paying. They're paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.",Trump,Nashville,2020
317,Through sanctions?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
318,I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.,Trump,Nashville,2020
319,Taxpayers money.,Biden,Nashville,2020
320,It's what?,Trump,Nashville,2020
321,Taxpayers money.,Biden,Nashville,2020
322,"No, the taxpayers. It's called China.",Trump,Nashville,2020
323,Not true.,Biden,Nashville,2020
324,"China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers.",Trump,Nashville,2020
325,"Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry.",Trump,Nashville,2020
326,"We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry",Trump,Nashville,2020
327,"OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
328,This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues.,Biden,Nashville,2020
329,"It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now.",Biden,Nashville,2020
330,"You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they're bald, because we have to wait another month.",Biden,Nashville,2020
331,"Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college?",Biden,Nashville,2020
332,They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble.,Biden,Nashville,2020
333,We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.,Biden,Nashville,2020
334,"I wanted to say, I want to tell —",Moderator,Nashville,2020
335,"That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.",Trump,Nashville,2020
336,"10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
337,"Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.",Trump,Nashville,2020
338,"All right, let's talk —",Moderator,Nashville,2020
339,"I'm not a typical politician, that's why I got elected.",Trump,Nashville,2020
340,Let's talk about —,Moderator,Nashville,2020
341,"Let's get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.",Trump,Nashville,2020
342,"We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
343,"You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled",Moderator,Nashville,2020
344,out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
345,Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
346,"When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.",Trump,Nashville,2020
347,He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea.,Trump,Nashville,2020
348,"Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability.",Trump,Nashville,2020
349,"In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship.",Trump,Nashville,2020
350,"We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area.",Trump,Nashville,2020
351,"They said, 'oh there's going to be trouble.' I said, 'No, they're not.",Trump,Nashville,2020
352,"Because he's not going to do that.' And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away,",Trump,Nashville,2020
353,"millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don't have a war, and I have a good relationship.",Trump,Nashville,2020
354,"Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
355,"Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root.",Biden,Nashville,2020
356,"I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, 'Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces?",Biden,Nashville,2020
357,"Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?' I said, 'Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them.",Biden,Nashville,2020
358,"We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up.",Biden,Nashville,2020
359,"And help if not, it's going to continue.' What has he done?",Biden,Nashville,2020
360,"He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles,",Biden,Nashville,2020
361,"able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.",Biden,Nashville,2020
362,"Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
363,On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.,Biden,Nashville,2020
364,"All right, let's move on to American families.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
365,"Kristen, they tried to meet with him.",Trump,Nashville,2020
366,"Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
367,"They tried to meet with him, he wouldn't do it. He didn't like Obama. He didn't like him. He wouldn't do it.",Trump,Nashville,2020
368,"OK, I've got to give him a chance to respond.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
369,"They tried, he wouldn't do it. And that's okay. You know what, North Korea, we're not in a war. We have a good relationship.",Trump,Nashville,2020
370,"You know, people don't understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.",Trump,Nashville,2020
371,"President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
372,"We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on.",Biden,Nashville,2020
373,"The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we're gonna talk about denuclearization, we're not gonna legitimize you, we're gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you.",Biden,Nashville,2020
374,That's why he wouldn't meet with us.,Biden,Nashville,2020
375,And it didn't happen.,Trump,Nashville,2020
376,Let's move on and talk about American families.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
377,"Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.",Trump,Nashville,2020
378,"We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.",Moderator,Nashville,2020

580,Check it out.,Biden,Nashville,2020
581,"All right, let's move on --",Moderator,Nashville,2020
582,But we don't have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don't have to worry about it,Trump,Nashville,2020
583,"All right, let's move on to the next section --",Moderator,Nashville,2020
584,You have 525 kids not knowing where in God's name they're going to be and lost their parents.,Biden,Nashville,2020
585,Go ahead.,Trump,Nashville,2020
586,"All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
587,"Part of that experience is something called ""the talk."" It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for",Moderator,Nashville,2020
588,"the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
589,"Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
590,"I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work.",Biden,Nashville,2020
591,"So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on.",Biden,Nashville,2020
592,"When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel.",Biden,Nashville,2020
593,And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.,Biden,Nashville,2020
594,"But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when",Biden,Nashville,2020
595,"you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel.",Biden,Nashville,2020
596,"Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America.",Biden,Nashville,2020
597,"And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal?",Biden,Nashville,2020
598,Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion.,Biden,Nashville,2020
599,This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore.,Biden,Nashville,2020
600,"We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do.",Biden,Nashville,2020
601,And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot.,Biden,Nashville,2020
602,"It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.",Biden,Nashville,2020
603,"President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
604,"Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community.",Trump,Nashville,2020
605,"And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators.",Trump,Nashville,2020
606,"Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done.",Trump,Nashville,2020
607,"Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it.",Trump,Nashville,2020
608,"But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture.",Trump,Nashville,2020
609,And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office.,Trump,Nashville,2020
610,"Two weeks later, they're out saying, 'Gee, we have to defeat him.' Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina.",Trump,Nashville,2020
611,He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It's one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made.,Trump,Nashville,2020
612,"Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities.",Trump,Nashville,2020
613,"After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office.",Trump,Nashville,2020
614,"And they said-- I said, 'What are you doing after three years?' I said, 'Why do you keep coming back?' 'Because we have no funding'.",Trump,Nashville,2020
615,"I said, 'You don't have to come back every year', 'We have to come back', because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did.",Trump,Nashville,2020
616,"Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, 'I think you need more'.",Trump,Nashville,2020
617,"And I said, 'The only bad part about this is I may never see you again', because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them.",Trump,Nashville,2020
618,But I saved colleges and universities.,Trump,Nashville,2020
619,"OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
620,"My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying.",Biden,Nashville,2020
621,"The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, 'The problem with",Biden,Nashville,2020
622,"the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,' and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, 'not enough people'.",Biden,Nashville,2020
623,"He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities.",Biden,Nashville,2020
624,"This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty.",Biden,Nashville,2020
625,"None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested.",Biden,Nashville,2020
626,"Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people's sentences. We committed over 1,000 people's sentences. Over 1,000.",Biden,Nashville,2020
627,"The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama.",Biden,Nashville,2020
628,"And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration.",Biden,Nashville,2020
629,"And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law.",Biden,Nashville,2020
630,That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem.,Biden,Nashville,2020
631,"They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.",Biden,Nashville,2020
632,"But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--",Trump,Nashville,2020
633,I am not--,Biden,Nashville,2020
634,You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.,Trump,Nashville,2020
635,We did--,Biden,Nashville,2020
636,"You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run.",Trump,Nashville,2020
637,"I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.",Trump,Nashville,2020
638,"All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.",Moderator,Nashville,2020

662,You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
663,What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
664,"Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting 'Pigs in a blanket', talking about police, 'Pigs, Pigs', talking about our",Trump,Nashville,2020
665,"police, 'Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon'. I said, 'That's a horrible thing'. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter.",Trump,Nashville,2020
666,"I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.",Trump,Nashville,2020
667,What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
668,"I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say.",Trump,Nashville,2020

673,He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board.,Biden,Nashville,2020
674,"He says to them about the 'Poor Boys', last time we were on stage here. He said, 'I told him to stand down and stand ready'. Come on.",Biden,Nashville,2020

676,"President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
677,He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--,Trump,Nashville,2020
678,You said you were Abraham Lincoln.,Biden,Nashville,2020
679,"No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn't say 'I'm Abraham Lincoln'.",Trump,Nashville,2020
680,"I said, 'Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community'. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--",Trump,Nashville,2020
681,"Oh, God.",Biden,Nashville,2020
682,"Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what?",Trump,Nashville,2020
683,"They remember it because it you look at what's happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what's happening out there.",Trump,Nashville,2020

687,"One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake.",Biden,Nashville,2020
688,"I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense.",Biden,Nashville,2020
689,They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends.,Biden,Nashville,2020
690,They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do.,Biden,Nashville,2020
691,"That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug.",Biden,Nashville,2020
692,But they were not in the crime bill.,Biden,Nashville,2020
693,"But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? 'That's what I'm gonna do when I become president'.",Trump,Nashville,2020
694,"You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done?",Trump,Nashville,2020

700,"I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.",Biden,Nashville,2020
701,"I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, 'I'm going to do that.",Trump,Nashville,2020
702,I'm going to do this.' You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done?,Trump,Nashville,2020

759,"And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about",Trump,Nashville,2020
760,"with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--",Trump,Nashville,2020
761,Find me a scientist that says that.,Biden,Nashville,2020
762,"Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--",Trump,Nashville,2020
763,False.,Biden,Nashville,2020
764,"So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry.",Trump,Nashville,2020
765,You want-- And what about fracking?,Trump,Nashville,2020
766,All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--,Moderator,Nashville,2020
767,I have never said I oppose fracking.,Biden,Nashville,2020
768,You said it on tape.,Trump,Nashville,2020
769,I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.,Biden,Nashville,2020
770,I'll put it on.,Trump,Nashville,2020
771,Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he's flat lying.,Biden,Nashville,2020
772,Would you rule out banning fracking?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
773,"I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025.",Biden,Nashville,2020
774,What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas.,Biden,Nashville,2020
775,We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.,Biden,Nashville,2020
776,I have one more question--,Moderator,Nashville,2020
777,"Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. 'I am against fracking', until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania?",Trump,Nashville,2020
778,He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.,Trump,Nashville,2020
779,"Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--",Biden,Nashville,2020
780,Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section.,Moderator,Nashville,2020
781,"President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
782,Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
783,"The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made.",Trump,Nashville,2020
784,"If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nine times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three",Trump,Nashville,2020
785,"years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more.",Trump,Nashville,2020
786,"Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it.",Trump,Nashville,2020
787,And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it.,Trump,Nashville,2020
788,"We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back.",Trump,Nashville,2020
789,We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.,Trump,Nashville,2020
790,"Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
791,"My response is that those people live on what they call 'Fence Lines'. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute.",Biden,Nashville,2020
792,"I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware.",Biden,Nashville,2020
793,"And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time.",Biden,Nashville,2020
794,"When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there'd be oil slick in the window.",Biden,Nashville,2020
795,"That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe.",Biden,Nashville,2020
796,"What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.",Biden,Nashville,2020
797,"OK, I have one final question--",Moderator,Nashville,2020
798,Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?,Trump,Nashville,2020
799,I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.,Biden,Nashville,2020
800,"Oh, transition.",Trump,Nashville,2020
801,It is a big statement because I would stop--,Biden,Nashville,2020
802,Why would you do that?,Moderator,Nashville,2020
803,Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —,Biden,Nashville,2020
804,That's a big statement.,Trump,Nashville,2020
805,"Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I'd stop giving to the oil industry-- I'd stop giving them federal subsidies.",Biden,Nashville,2020
806,"You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?",Biden,Nashville,2020
807,We actually do give it to solar and wind--,Trump,Nashville,2020
808,"All right, we have one final question--",Moderator,Nashville,2020
809,That's the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.,Trump,Nashville,2020
810,"All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--",Moderator,Nashville,2020
811,Because basically what he's saying is he's going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?,Trump,Nashville,2020
812,"Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?",Moderator,Nashville,2020
813,"He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production.",Biden,Nashville,2020
814,"By 2050, totally.",Biden,Nashville,2020
815,All right. One final question--,Moderator,Nashville,2020
816,Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?,Trump,Nashville,2020
817,"No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
818,"No, I'm going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to",Biden,Nashville,2020
819,But that'll cost you $1 trillion.,Trump,Nashville,2020
820,"This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump.. Imagine this is your Inauguration Day.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
821,"What will you say in your address to Americans who did not vote for you? You'll each have one minute, starting with you.",Moderator,Nashville,2020
822,"We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China.",Trump,Nashville,2020
823,"Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc..",Trump,Nashville,2020
824,"But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together.",Trump,Nashville,2020
825,"We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas MIT graduates, number one in the class-- everybody had the best numbers.",Trump,Nashville,2020
