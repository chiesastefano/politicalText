## Abstract

This project investigates the use of emotion and rhetorical strategies in U.S. presidential debates. Starting from raw transcripts, a pipeline for text preprocessing, emotion classification, and visualisation was developed. The analysis incorporates transformer-based models and interpretable machine learning techniques to extract and analyse persuasive language over time. The ultimate goal is to understand how candidates strategically deploy emotion to influence audiences, with particular attention to temporal and speaker-level patterns.
