# politicalText

**politicalText** is a project for analysing and interpreting political rhetoric using Natural Language Processing techniques. We work with real-world presidential debate transcripts to uncover patterns in emotional expression, rhetorical strategy, and persuasion, with a focus on explainable AI and interpretability.

## Project Goals

- **Emotion & Rhetoric Analysis**: Investigate how political figures express emotions and use rhetorical devices during debates.
- **Model Interpretability**: Apply interpretability techniques to NLP models to understand which textual elements drive predictions.
- **Text Mining at Scale**: Use scalable text-analytics methods to extract persuasive patterns from large corpora of political speech.
